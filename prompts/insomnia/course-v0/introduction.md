This treatment will require you to make some major changes in your sleep habits so you
can improve your sleep. However, before you learn these new habits, it is important that you have a
better understanding of your sleep needs and what controls the amount and quality of sleep you
obtain. The information presented in this educational recording should help you understand how your
body’s sleep system works and prepare you for the specific treatment suggestions you will be given.

Before you make any changes in your sleep habits, it is important that you ask the question,
'How much sleep do I need each night?' Generally speaking, there is no one amount of sleep that ‘fits’
everyone. Most normal adults need 6 to 8 hours of sleep per night. However, some people need only 3
or 4 hours of sleep each night but others require 10 to 12 hours of sleep on a nightly basis. At this
point, it is important set aside any previous notions or beliefs you might have about your sleep needs.
These beliefs may be wrong and may hinder your progress. The treatment we give you will help you
discover the amount of sleep that satisfies your needs and lets you feel alert and energetic during the
day.

In addition to getting rid of any old ideas you have about your sleep
needs, it is important that you learn some things about how your
body’s sleep system works. People, like many animals, have powerful
internal 'clocks' that affect their behavior and bodily functioning.
These 'clocks' seem to work in roughly 24-hour periods and produce
24-hour cycles in such things as digestion, body temperature, and the
sleep/wake pattern. For example, if we record a person’s body
temperature for several days in a row, we will see a consistent up and
down pattern or rhythm in temperature across each 24-hour day. The
temperature will be at its lowest point around 3 or 4 AM, will rise
through the morning and early
