Some treatments for schizophrenia can increase the risk of weight gain and
obesity. Sticking to a healthy diet is a good way to minimize this risk. Your
doctor will monitor your weight and, if weight gain becomes a problem, it may be
worth discussing different medication options.

Drinking to excess should be avoided, not only to improve your general health
but also because there is a strong association between schizophrenia and
alcoholism, which means that the risk of becoming addicted to alcohol is greater
if you have schizophrenia. Therefore, it is a good idea to moderate your
drinking as much as possible.

There are several reasons to incorporate a physical exercise regimen into your
lifestyle. First, getting a good amount of exercise will help you to control
your weight in combination with a healthy diet. Secondly, exercise can put you
in a better frame of mind, as hormones released during exercise are associated
with improved mood. Exercise can also improve the way you sleep.

People with schizophrenia tend to have disrupted sleep patterns: you may find
yourself sleeping more or less than most people, or at different times of the
day. This can lead to excessive tiredness, known as fatigue. A change in sleep
patterns can be the first sign of a psychotic episode, and therefore can be
taken as a warning sign. Maintaining a regular routine can help you to get your
sleep patterns back to normal. This can include having a bedtime routine, going
to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time. Relaxation techniques,
such as meditation, can help to reduce stress; this is important because stress
can stop you sleeping peacefully. Caffeine should be avoided, especially in the
evening, as it can disrupt your sleep.
