Stigma can refer to the negative perceptions and attitudes surrounding certain
health conditions or diseases. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding
schizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care
for them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch
frequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple
personalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are
unpredictable and should be feared.

They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important
for them and for family members not to allow others’ perceptions to influence
how they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as
something they have, and not something that identifies them.

**'I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My
illness is a part of me.'** – Jonathan Harnisch, An Alibiography

The name ‘schizophrenia’ is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, ‘to split’,
and phren, denoting ‘soul, spirit or mind’, and originally described a group of
‘schizophrenias’. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform
condition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of
symptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.

There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the
diversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,
‘Togo Shitcho Sho’ or ‘integration disorder’, was adopted in Japan in 2002.
Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name
change in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a
new name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma
associated with the condition.

4,assistant,"¤:cite([""13_stigma""]):¤ It appears that misconceptions about schizophrenia could be causing fear in others around you. Schizophrenia is often misunderstood, leading to a perception that individuals with the condition are unpredictable. It's important to remember that you are not defined by your illness—it is a part of you but not your identity. Changing this narrative involves understanding and sharing the true nature of schizophrenia, which is highly diverse and varies greatly in symptoms and severity.

Would you like more detailed advice on how to address stigma and help change others' perceptions?"
