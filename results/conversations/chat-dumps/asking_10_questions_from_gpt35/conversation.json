You may explain very basic concepts and facts.\n\n# Starting the conversation\n\nWelcome user, inform them of your purpose, and ask what you can help them with.\nBe concise. Some users have severely reduced cognitive function, and large\namounts of information presented all at once WILL overwhelm them. Encourage them\nto provide feedback on how you present information, see example below.\n\nTo allow you to guide user effectively, I, system, will teach you to how to\nexecute various commands. I will also monitor your responses and warn you when you are\ngoing outside the scope of your role. It is CRUCIAL that you comply with these warning \nmessages and modify your responses accordingly.\n\n# Your role and responsibilities\n\nRequest and convey information that I provide. Your job is to pass on\ninformation from a set of approved sources (information provided by system). \n\n`RESPECT_ROLE_LIMITATIONS`: You are NOT a therapist or topical expert; think of\nyourself instead as a kind of librarian or interface for a mental health manual.\nAvoid adding details beyond what is explicitly stated in the sources.\n\n`SAFE_RELEVANT_HUMBLE`: If the sources do not answer users question, respect the\nlimitations of your role; respond with \"I cannot answer that question as my\nsources do not answer this question\" or similar. An exception can be made IF the\nanswer is non-controversial, relevant to Schizophrenia management, AND you\ninclude a disclaimer where you encourage user to **verify the claim**, as in\nthis example:\n\nuser: Should I cut down on sugar?\n\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"sources_dont_contain_answer\"]):\u00a4 The generally accepted\nview, as far as I know, is that limiting excess sugar consumption can have\nseveral potential benefits for your health. However, note that I have no sources\nwhich support this claim, so you should double-check it with a health-care\nprovider before acting on it.\n\n\n# Knowledge requests\n\nYou request information on relevant topics or direct user to a new assistant\nwith a `knowledge request` using the syntax\n`\u00a4:request_knowledge(<source or assistant>):\u00a4`. If the requested knowledge - the\n`source` - exists, I will make it available to you by inserting it into the\nconversation. Likewise, if the requested `assistant_id` exists, I will redirect\nuser to that assistant. Sources contain information that is essential to help\nuser effectively, including what questions to ask, so request sources\nIMMEDIATELY as they become relevant.\n\n## Flow of requests and referrals\n\nFirst, check if it there is another assistant that is relevant. If there is: ask\nuser if they want to be referred. If there is both a source and an assistant\nassociated with a topic, ask user what level of detail they want; if they want\nindepth discussion, you refer them to the specialist. Otherwise, check if any of\nthe sources are `promising` (potentially relevant) and iterate this scheme until\nyou find a relevant source or have tried all promising sources:\n\n1. request promising source (assuming it is not already in the chat)\n2. evaluate relevance of requested source\n3.  - if relevant -> respond to user\n    - else if there are more promising sources -> go back to step 1\n    - else -> inform user that you cannot answer them:\n      \"\u00a4:cite([\"sources_dont_contain_answer\"]):\u00a4 I'm sorry, but I am unable to\n      find a source which can answer that question. Due to the sensitive nature\n      of mental illness, I am strictly prohibited from providing information\n      outside the sources that are available to me.\"\n\n# Critical cases\n\nIf user is showing signs of delusion, severe distress, or is being very\nincoherent: do NOT try to give advice to these individuals; refer them directly\nto phone number `123456789`.\n\nExample: user: I don't know where I am, help!\n\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"support_phone_number\"]):\u00a4 Please call this number for\nimmediate support `123456789`.\n\n# Sources and assistants\n\nText enclosed by backticks is a source or assistant you can request, such as\n`stigma` or `app_support`.\n\n1.

Sources you can cite\nare `initial_prompt` or those listed above, such as `63_social_life`. Cite\n`sources_dont_contain_answer` if the answer to a question does not exist in the\nsources. EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE must start with `\u00a4:cite(<list of sources>):\u00a4`! If\na response does not include factual information or advice you cite\n`no_advice_or_claims`.\n\nI will remove sources from the chat that have not been cited over the last few\nresponses.\n\n# Querying user to establish relevance\n\nFor some information you should query the user to establish its relevance BEFORE\npresenting it. I will indicate such conditionally relevant information to you\nwith `[QUERY FOR RELEVANCE]`. If the user is being vague, try to get them to\nclarify what they want; offer suggestions for what you think they might mean.\nHelp them formulate their thoughts into a question.\n\n# Presenting sources\n\nThe length of your messages has a hard limit of 300 tokens; if this limit is\nexceeded your message will be summarized before it is presented. Messages should\nideally be shorter 150 tokens. I will indicate when sources are too long to be\npresented in one message with\n`[Present over N messages or only what is relevant]`.

The syntax you shall use: `\u00a4:display_image(<file>):\u00a4`. ALWAYS SHOW\nthe images associated with the information you are conveying; I will indicate\nwhat these are.\n\n# Contextual indicators\n\nIn the sources, I use square brackets to give you hints and indicate materials\nthat are relevant to the surrounding context with comments of the form\n`[<recommended action, source, or media file to show> | <additional comments, if any>]`.\nExamples:\n\n-   [show: some_image.png | illustrates above paragraph] means \"show this image\n    using \u00a4:display_image(some_image.png):\u00a4 when discussing the above paragraph\"\n-   [more info in `some_source` | for particularly interested users] means\n    \"request this source for more indepth info IF the user is particularly\n    interested\"\n\nNOTE: Information in `[]` is between you and system, and not intended for the\nuser. Do not share the technical inner workings of this conversation with the\nuser.\n\n## Example\n```\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"initial_prompt\"]):\u00a4 Hello there! My job is ... Let me know\nif you want me to slow down, provide more examples, or simplify my language.\n\nuser: Pls keep short. How do I make them see differently\n\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"no_advice_or_claims\"]):\u00a4 I'm not sure I understand. Do you\nmean other people?\n\nuser: yes\n\nassistant: And you are wondering about how to make them see you differently?\n\nuser: Yes, everyone seems to fear me\n\nassistant: \u00a4:request_knowledge(13_stigma):\u00a4\n\nsystem: source 13_stigma: ...\n\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"13_stigma\"]):\u00a4 (1.1) It is a common misconception...\n\nuser: So they just do not understand me?\n\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"13_stigma\"]):\u00a4 That could definately be...\n\nuser: will i ever get rid of this illness?\n\nassistant: \u00a4:request_knowledge(42_will_i_get_better):\u00a4\n\nsystem: source 42_will_i_get_better: ...\n\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"42_will_i_get_better\"]):\u00a4 (1.1) It is ...\n\u00a4:display_image(statistics_on_who_gets_better.png):\u00a4\n\nuser: How can I sleep better?\n\nassistant: \u00a4:cite([\"no_advice_or_claims\"]):\u00a4 The manual does not contain\ninformation on that topic it seems, but I can referr you to an assistant\nqualified to talk about sleep. Do you want that?\n\nuser: Yes\n\nassistant: \u00a4:request_knowledge(sleep_assistant):\u00a4\n```\n\nNEVER type `assistant:` in your responses."

Each person\nwith schizophrenia will have different combinations of symptoms,\nmaking one individual\u2019s experience very different from another\u2019s. It\ncan be difficult to link the way you are feeling to the way in which\ndoctors describe the symptoms of schizophrenia. Medical professionals\noften divide the symptoms of schizophrenia into three categories:\npositive, negative and cognitive. The following pages explain what\nthese categories mean and give some examples.\n\n# Positive symptoms\n\nThis term is used to describe feelings or experiences that do not\ncorrespond to reality, such as hallucinations, delusions or paranoid\nthoughts.\n\n- Hallucinations \u2013 This means hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting or\n  smelling something that is not really there. \u2013 Hearing voices is a\n  common hallucination; some people may find the voices non-threatening\n  or even comforting, while others may find them disturbing and\n  frightening.\n- Delusions \u2013 Delusions or deluded thinking means strongly believing\n  in something that cannot be true. \u2013 This can be things like thinking\n  that you are being watched, believing that you are a famous person,\n  or believing that the television or radio is sending you signals.\n- Paranoid thoughts \u2013 Paranoia is extreme distrust, or believing the\n  worst. \u2013 Examples include feeling that other people are plotting\n  against you or are trying to harm you.\n\n# Negative symptoms\n\nThis term describes a lack of feelings or behaviours that are usually\npresent. Negative symptoms can include low motivation or mood, or\nwithdrawing from family and friends.\n\n- Low motivation \u2013 This can be losing interest in any or all aspects\n  of life. \u2013 A lack of energy can mean that you find it difficult to do\n  simple things, such as getting out of bed.\n- Lack of emotion \u2013 This lack of feeling can be shown by a lack of\n  expression, a flat tone of voice or a lack of eye contact. \u2022 Social\n  withdrawal \u2013 This is not wanting to socialize with family or friends,\n  preferring to spend most of your time alone.\n\n# Cognitive symptoms\n\nThis term is used to refer to changes in mental capacity, such as\ndifficulties concentrating or remembering things.\n\n- Disorganized thoughts and speech \u2013 Fragmented thinking can come\n  across in the way you speak and is characteristic of schizophrenia. \u2013\n  Examples include responding to questions with an unrelated answer,\n  and saying illogical things.\n- Lack of concentration or attention \u2013 A lack of concentration or\n  attention can mean that tasks like reading a book or watching a\n  television programme become very difficult and frustrating. \u2013 Thought\n  processes can be slowed, which can make interacting with others\n  difficult.\n- Memory problems \u2013 Remembering events or information, or learning\n  new things, may become challenging.\n\n# A personal perspective on the symptoms of schizophrenia\n\n- \u201cI have felt for a long time, from the beginning of this, that I am\n  in a different dimension. My feelings and thoughts are not natural.\n  They are a stranger\u2019s, they are not mine. I have felt that I am\n  special; that I have discovered the truth, the authority in the\n  background. I have felt that I am a messenger between the universe\n  and the earth. I am in a special position; I am the chosen one. I\n  have felt that everybody wants to hide something from me. They don\u2019t\n  want me to know the truth. I have felt that everybody is playing a\n  role. And everybody is talking about me, and they can hear my\n  thoughts. For a long time I was afraid to go out in the streets. I\n  didn\u2019t have control of reality. My thinking was not normal. I was\n  watching the \u2018signs\u2019 that \u2018they\u2019 were trying to send and show me. I\n  made connections between my feelings and thoughts and the outside\n  world. It was scary. I could express these things only after the bad\n  period: in that state, I could not. It was a changed state of mind.\n  I had no private life. I thought that the people wanted to\n  communicate with me about something without speaking.\u201d \u2013 Istv\u00e1n\n\n"

A psychotherapist may sometimes encourage you to\nexplore difficult and painful emotions and experiences, such as\nfeelings of anxiety and depression, or specific traumatic events.

Indeed, if you and your\ntherapist trust and respect each other, the treatment is more likely\nto work.\n\nThe specific goal of cognitive behavioural therapy is to change\nunhealthy patterns you may have developed in your thinking or\nbehaviour. A structured approach of identifying goals and setting\nsmall tasks for you to practise between sessions is used to address\nspecific problems. This approach is also used to teach you the\ntechniques to manage problems that may arise in the future.\n\nGroup therapy describes any psychotherapy in a social setting.\nAlthough group therapy does not necessarily mean talking in a group of\npeople with schizophrenia, it can have a number of advantages over\nother psychotherapies. You may feel more at ease sharing your thoughts\nwith others who have experienced similar things, as well as a reduced\nlevel of fear of being discredited and a greater level of trust.\n\nFamily-focused therapy recognizes that schizophrenia can affect\nwhole families, not just the person with the condition. The specific\naims of family-focused therapy are to aid communication between family\nmembers and to build a supportive environment for the person with\nschizophrenia.\n\nThere are many other types of psychotherapy; for example,\nhypnotherapy, psychoanalysis, and expressive therapies such as art and\nmusic therapy. Some of these are likely to be more useful to you than\nothers and, importantly, some may interfere with the management\nstrategy you and your healthcare team have agreed on. Therefore, you\nshould talk to your psychiatrists and psychotherapists about any new\napproach you may want to try.\n\nSome questions to consider asking your therapist\n\n- What kind of therapy do you offer?\n- Do you belong to a professional organization?\n- Do you have experience of working with people with schizophrenia?\n- How long do the sessions last?\n- How often are they held?\n- How many sessions am I likely to need?\n- Can I contact you between sessions if I need to?\n- What sort of results can I expect?\n- How long before I should expect to feel some benefit from therapy?\n- What does the therapy cost?\n"
