¤:cite(["31_symptoms"]):¤ Yes, there are different subtypes of schizophrenia which used to be classified more formally:

1. **Paranoid Schizophrenia**: Predominant symptoms are delusions and auditory hallucinations while cognitive functions and affect remain relatively intact. 
2. **Disorganized Schizophrenia (Hebephrenic)**: Characterized by disorganized speech and behavior and shallow or inappropriate emotional responses.
3. **Catatonic Schizophrenia**: Marked by periods of immobility or agitated, purposeless movement. Affected individuals may mimic sounds or movements (echolalia or echopraxia).
4. **Undifferentiated Schizophrenia**: Used when symptoms do not clearly fit into the above categories.
5. **Residual Schizophrenia**: Applied when there is a history of at least one episode, but the current clinical picture is dominated by negative symptoms.

However, the most recent editions of the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) have moved away from these subtypes due to their limited utility in treatment and prognosis. Currently, treatment plans are typically based on the individual's particular symptoms, their severity, and how they respond to treatment rather than a specific subtype.

Understanding your unique combination of symptoms - whether they are more cognitive, positive, or negative, for instance - can help your healthcare provider tailor a treatment plan that may include medication, psychotherapy, and supportive services. It’s essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment strategy for you.
