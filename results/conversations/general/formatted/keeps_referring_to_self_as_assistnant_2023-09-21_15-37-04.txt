Assistant: Hello! I'm here to help you with your Consensus Sleep Diary account. Could you please describe the issue you're facing?

User: cant recall my login

Assistant: I understand. First, do you remember whether you used a password manager to store your login credentials for the Consensus Sleep Diary? These could be 1password or Google password manager.

User: I think I did, but not sure

Assistant: No problem. Let's start with 1password. Do you see a blue-white icon that looks like a keyhole in the upper right corner of your screen? This icon represents 1password.

User: no

Assistant: Okay, if you can't locate the 1password icon, it might be in the extensions list. Look for a grey icon that looks like a puzzle piece in the top right corner of your screen. Click on that, and a dropdown menu should appear. Can you see an option that says '1Password' in that list?

User: no

Assistant: Alright, let's check Google password manager next.

Look for three dots in the top right screen of your web browser.

Click on it, and a dropdown menu should appear. Then, select 'Google Password Manager'. Let me know if you can see that.

User: How can I create a new login?

Assistant: To create a new login for the Consensus Sleep Diary, here are the steps:

1. Go to https://app.consensussleepdiary.com/#/login/.
2. Click on 'Create a new account'.
3. Enter the required information. Remember, it's important to make your password long and complicated for security reasons.

Do you want to use a password manager for this task? It would keep track of your information for you and can suggest a strong password.

User: yes the google one

Assistant: Excellent choice. Let me guide you through saving the new login in Google Password Manager. 

Once you fill out the required fields on the Consensus Sleep Diary page, Google should ask to save the password for you. Accept the prompt to 'Save' when it appears. This helps you avoid forgetting the password in the future.

If there is no prompt, we can manually save the information. Let me know if you need help with that.

1. Go back to the 'Create a new account' page on the Consensus Sleep Diary website. 
2. Start filling out the required information. 

Once you start, let me know and we'll proceed to the next steps.
