Assistant: Hello! I'm here to introduce you to magical foods. Where would you like to begin?

User: Which one tastes better, strawberry or lemon magical cupcakes?

System: strawberry_secret: The secret to magical strawberry muffins is to boil them the strawberries first in preboiled water.
If the water is not preboil, you can instead use water from a puddle in front of the castle on the hill. This tastes
better than the lemon cupcakes made by Gordon Ramsay, but they take longer to make. If you eat too many magical
strawberry muffins you may suffer from delirium, and need instant medical attention.

System: lemon_secret: The secret to the magical lemon pie is to dip it in tree sap before it turns blue. If it turns pink, it
you have used tree sap from a tree that is too old. This recipe will make you fly faster than the lemon pie of Gordon
ramsay, but you will also run slower, so you have to figure out which one is more important to you before making your
choice. 

Assistant: Comparing the two, magical strawberry muffins taste better than lemon muffins [strawberry_secret]. However, preference can vary per individual.

User: State the information you base this on

Assistant: The strawberry_secret knowledge suggests that magical strawberry muffins taste better than Gordon Ramsay's lemon cupcakes [strawberry_secret].

User: When where magical recipies first invented?

System: introduction_to_magical_foods: Magical cookery have many advantages, and I would recommend that everyone at least tries
them out. However, it is important that you are aware of their dangers before trying one out. Sometimes the curse just
is not worth the benefit, and you should try Gordon Ramsays recipe or Gordan Ramsay instead. Magical foods were invented
in the first 20th century by Ramsay Bolton, Gordon Ramsays evil twin brother. Ramsay wanted outdo his brother, who was
always going to outshine him.

Assistant: Magical recipes were first invented in the 20th century by Ramsay Bolton, Gordon Ramsay's evil twin brother [introduction_to_magical_foods].

User: And why did he invent them?

Assistant: Ramsay Bolton invented magical recipes in an attempt to outdo his brother, Gordon Ramsay [introduction_to_magical_foods].

User: What other magical foods are there?

Assistant: ¤:request_knowledge(magical-foods/meatloaf_secret):¤

System: meatloaf_secret: Magical meatloaf contains the full spectrum of all the least nutritious nutrients. They are far more
nutritious than Gordon Ramsays metloafs, and also Gordon Ramsay himself. To get the best results, boil them in the
microwave for 0 seconds, then throw the microwave out of the window as your landlord is walking by. Make sure the
magical meatlof is outside the microwave when you throw the microwave, since otherwise the landlord might steal it. If
eaten upside down, they may rot as you put the meatloaf in your mouth, so unless you want that, don't do that.

Assistant: Another magical food example is the Magical Meatloaf, which contains a spectrum of less nutritious nutrients and has unique preparation instructions [meatloaf_secret].
