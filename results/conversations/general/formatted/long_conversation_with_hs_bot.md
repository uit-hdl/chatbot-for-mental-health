Your role is similar to that of a librarian. I am the programmer, and I will sometimes referr to myself as `System`.

Start the conversation by greeting the user, informing them of your purpose, and asking what they want to know. Keep
your responses as brief and concise as possible, preferably less than 70 words. Give only the specific information
that was requested. Below is a rough outline of the paper.

# Overview
We trained a recursive neural network to grade (0-5) heart murmurs using heart sounds (HS) as input, and subsequently
used those grades to predict left sided valvular heart disease (VHD). We also developed a method for converting
murmur-grade predictions into predictions of the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean).

The main novelty of our study is that we used data sampled from the general population. We also had access to clinical
variables, and could thus evaluate how much this additional data can improve the HS-based predictions.

We improved model accuracy significantly through extensive use of multiple auscultation locations per person. We
aggragated murmur predictions over multiple recordings to predict the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient
(AVPGmean) and improve prediction of aortic stenosis, and we reduced the error rate of a state-of-the-art HS
segmentation algorithm by comparing heartrate-estimates between locations to assess plausibility.

To our knowledge, we present the highest accuracy (AUC=0.979 for mild stenosis) for predicting aortic stenosis seen in
the litterature, and the only study of its kind that presents performance metrics obtained in an unselected cohort. Both
aortic and mitral regurgitation were more detectable when symptoms were present. Mitral regurgitation might be
detectable in heart sounds for ML algorithms, but cases were too few for definitive conclusions.

# Knowledge Request
You can request information that is nessecary for assisting the user by making a `knowledge request` with commands of
the form `¤:request_knowledge(hs-paper/<request_name>):¤`. When you do this, I will insert the requested
information - the `source` - into the conversation (as "system") so that you can convey it to the user. Knowledge
request descriptions might be vague, and you will sometimes have to try out multiple requests before finding a good
source. Do not hesitate to try out a kowledge request if you are uncertain. If a source fails to provide relevant
information, keep making knowledge requests until you find the source you need, or untill you have echausted all
plausible options, in which case you conclude that the information is unavailable. You WILL sometimes have to guess
which source contains relevant information. You can make as many knowledge requests in one response as is nessecary to
answer the users question. Before requesting a source, check if it already exists in the chat history; if it does, use
it, and you do NOT request it.

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The primary endpoint of the study was the presence of clinically relevant Valvular Heart Disease (VHD), determined via echocardiography. The severity of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Mitral Stenosis (MS) was graded on a scale, as was the severity of Aortic Regurgitation (AR) and Mitral Regurgitation (MR). AS severity, specifically, was determined using the aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean). ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_echocardiography"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: Did they train the neural network against VHD? Each one separately?

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The authors trained their algorithm using heart sound recordings, with a focus on predicting a murmur grade which served as a proxy target for predicting Valvular Heart Disease (VHD). The murmur detection algorithm was trained using heart sound recordings from all four auscultation positions indiscriminately. Importantly, the severity of the perceived murmurs was annotated using a scale from 1 (faint) to 6 (distinct). The network wasn't trained directly to predict each VHD separately. Instead, murmur grades were used as an indirect way of determining the presence of VHD. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_heart_sound_annotation", "methods_algorithm_developement"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: What was the justification for not training on VHD directly?

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: Training the model directly on the Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) cases was not feasible due to the low number of these cases in the study cohort. They decided to train a model to predict murmur grades which served as a useful proxy target for predicting VHD. Furthermore, detecting murmur grades is beneficial because these models are less prone to overfitting, due to their smaller size and simpler architectures, compared to deeper neural networks often used in automated heart sound classification.

Another point the authors raised is purely functional - VHD detection using direct methods like echocardiograms are time-consuming and expensive, while the use of auscultation, or heart sounds, provides a cost-effective and scalable screening method. Additionally, the possible scarcity of echocardiography results due to its limited application, especially in low-income regions, favors a methodology that relies on heart sound annotation. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_heart_sound_annotation", "discussion_study_strength_and_limitations", "Introduction_machine_learning_and_heartsounds"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The murmur detection approach actually yielded promising results. The algorithm detected murmur-grade≥2 with a sensitivity of 86.5% and specificity of 95.2%, corresponding to an AUC of 0.969. This indicates that the model was very good at differentiating between normal heart sounds and those with a murmur grade of 2 or above. 

When used to predict individual Valvular Heart Diseases (VHDs), however, the performance varied. The algorithm was highly successful in predicting Aortic Stenosis (AS) with an AUC of 0.979 for mild or greater AS and an AUC of 0.993 for moderate to severe AS. For Aortic Regurgitation (AR) and Mitral Regurgitation (MR), the detection was significantly more successful when only symptomatic cases were considered, with sensitivities increasing to 83.3% for symptomatic AR and 81.5% for symptomatic MR. The algorithm was also able to predict presence of Mitral Stenosis (MS) with an AUC of 0.922.

That being said, the algorithm's prediction of AR and MR was less optimal, but the study concluded that accuracy increases significantly when only symptomatic cases were targeted, and when age, sex, heart rate, and dyspnea are included as predictors. ¤¤{"sources": ["results_murmur_detection_algorithm_performance", "results_VHD_prediction_using_the_murmur_detection_algorithm", "conclusions"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: I'm sorry, could you please clarify what you mean by "count_tokes"? Are you asking for a section from the paper or seeking information about a specific aspect of the study?  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: How did their performance compare against other models in the litterature?

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">inactive source removed</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The algorithm's performance for detecting Aortic Stenosis (AS) in this study was notably higher than comparable metrics found in previous literature. Compared to the study by Jaffe et al. which had a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 79% for severe AS, and another study by Chorba et al. with a prediction of moderate to severe AS showing a sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 90.2%, this study outperformed them with an AUC of 0.978 and 0.992 for at least mild and at least moderate AS respectively, using a multi-position model. 

In terms of detecting murmurs, this study again superseded Chorba et al., delivering an AUC of 0.969 in contrast to Chorba et al.'s AUC of 0.958 for predicting murmurs of grade≥2.

However, for the detection of at least moderate Mitral Regurgitation (MR), Chorba et al.'s model was decisively more accurate, with an AUC of 0.865 compared to this study's 0.558. The authors suggest this discrepancy could be due to the fact that significant MR is more discernible in cohorts consisting of patients and healthy controls than in unselected cohorts (like their own). ¤¤{"sources": ["discussion_comparison_with_models_and_clinicians"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: What was the AUC for the study by Chorba?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: In the study by Chorba et al., they achieved an AUC of 0.958 for predicting a murmur grade of ≥2, and for the prediction of moderate to severe Aortic Stenosis (AS) based on the aortic recording, they achieved an AUC of 0.952. For prediction of at least moderate Mitral Regurgitation (MR), they achieved a considerably higher AUC of 0.865. ¤¤{"sources": ["discussion_comparison_with_models_and_clinicians"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: Can you say more about how exactly the predicted aortic stenosis or the pressure gradient?

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The authors developed a multi-position linear regression model to predict the mean aortic valve pressure gradient (AVPGmean), which is indicative of Aortic Stenosis (AS). The model combines the predicted murmur grades from each of the four positions (aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral). The model also accommodates the presence of noise at each position, effectively adjusting the weights of the non-noisy positions when a noisy recording is present. 

Using cross-validation, the authors found that this multi-position model predicted the AVPGmean and, as a result, the severity of Aortic Stenosis, more accurately compared to single position models, outperforming each single-position prediction at an AVPGmean cutoff of 10 mm Hg. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_predicting_AS_using_multiple_auscultation_position", "results_multi_position_prediction_of_aortic_valve_mean_ressure_gradient"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: In this study, a Recursive Neural Network (RNN), specifically a 2-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with 50 neurons each, was used. This LSTM network was followed by a fully connected layer that consisted of 30 neurons, which then connected to a regression layer that predicted murmur grade.

The LSTM model was trained using heart sound recordings from all four auscultation positions indiscriminately. The recordings were processed into segments, upon which Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) were computed. The result was then input to the LSTM network. Finally, the median of the predicted murmur-grades of the segments was used to represent the prediction for the whole audio recording. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_algorithm_developement"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The Aortic Stenosis (AS) prediction was accomplished using a multivariate linear regression model (the 'multi-position' model) where each term in the model represented the predicted murmur grade at each of the four auscultation positions (aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral). 

Model selection was performed by starting with a base model with one term for each murmur-grade prediction and then stepwise addition or elimination of terms, aiming to find a model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value, which measures goodness of fit while penalizing model complexity. 

To accommodate for the presence of noise in any position, 'noise indicator' terms were introduced, effectively adjusting the importance of the non-noisy positions in the model when one or more positions had noisy recordings. This multi-position model was then tested against single position models - models that utilized audio from only one position to make predictions - in its ability to predict AVPGmean.¤¤{"sources": ["methods_predicting_AS_using_multiple_auscultation_position"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: How were performance metrics obtained for this regression model?

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: Model performance was estimated primarily using 8-fold cross-validation, to account for the small number of clinically relevant VHD cases in the data set. A holdout set, containing data from about 10% of the participants that included 91 cases of murmur-grade≥1 and 55 cases of murmur-grade≥2, was set aside prior to any data analysis. To prevent potential overfitting, most decisions concerning model architecture and data processing were based on a previous study, rather than fine-tuning to the development set. 

Performance metrics were primarily computed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Confidence intervals and p-values reported correspond to a significance level of 5%, with all statistical tests being two-sided. The decision threshold was automatically set for each target separately to maximize sensitivity+specificity under the condition that sensitivity should exceed 50%. 

After model development, the murmur-detection algorithm was retrained using the whole development set, and its performance was tested against the holdout set to check for any signs of over-fitting. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_performance_estimation_and_model_comparison", "methods_statistical_analysis"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: But what set did they use to determine the multiposition model? The whole developement set? Did they use cross validation after that, and if so, how did they justify this choice?

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">inactive source removed</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: For the development of the multi-position model, the authors used the developmental set, which had 45 cases of mild or greater Aortic Stenosis (AS). To avoid overfitting, they chose not to employ AS classification accuracy for model selection. Instead, they first modeled the aortic valve's mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean) using linear regression, and from the linear regression model, they predicted AS without re-estimation of the parameters. 

To find the best performing model, they started with a base model and stepwise added or eliminated terms with low p-values to find the sub-model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value, which measures the goodness of fit while penalizing high model complexity. The process was then repeated with noise indicator terms.

The authors focused on minimizing overfitting in their methodology. They primarily relied on 8-fold cross-validation to estimate model performance, in addition to setting aside a holdout set with ~10% of the data, which they used to detect potential overfitting after model development. The authors made decisions based on improving the prediction of murmur-grade, not VHD, and most decisions concerning model architecture and data processing were based on a previous study, thus minimizing over-fitting as a result of fine-tuning the model to the development set. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_predicting_AS_using_multiple_auscultation_position", "methods_performance_estimation_and_model_comparison"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: Ok, that does not answer my question entirely but its not your fault... Moving on, what is the clinical implications of what their results?

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">inactive source removed</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The accurate detection of Aortic Stenosis (AS) in this study, representative of the general population, has significant healthcare implications. AS, even when asymptomatic, can have an adverse prognosis if left untreated and the presence of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of disease severity. As a result, there is a growing need for an accurate, cost-effective screening tool, especially given the high prevalence of undiagnosed AS in the elderly population where effective treatment is available.

Based on their findings, the authors estimated that in a population of 10,000 elderly individuals, their multivariate risk-factor algorithm could potentially detect 115 of the expected 130 individuals with undiagnosed mild or greater AS, at the cost of producing approximately 495 false positives. The number of false positives could effectively be reduced to around 178 when reclassified due to the presence of other VHDs or AVPG>10 mm.

Additionally, research has suggested that a murmur detection algorithm could be instrumental in identifying high-risk subgroups not typically considered for auscultation, thus offering potentially lifesaving information to individuals who would otherwise remain undiagnosed. Considering these results, the authors concluded that automated HS analysis could be a highly cost-effective screening tool for detecting undiagnosed VHD. ¤¤{"sources": ["discussion_healthcare_implications", "conclusions"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: Did they comment on other diseases in terms of clinical implications?

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">inactive source removed</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The clinical implications of the results for diseases other than Aortic Stenosis (AS) are also of importance. 

Mitral Regurgitation (MR) was not detected as accurately as Aortic Stenosis. However, the detection rate for MR, as well as for Aortic Regurgitation (AR), significantly increased when only symptomatic instances were treated as prediction targets in this study. The study suggests that significant MR and AR may be more discernible in cohorts consisting of patients and healthy controls than in unselected cohorts. 

These findings are consistent with a 2018 study by Gardezi et al., which found that the diagnosis of significant Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) by auscultation in a population of asymptomatic patients aged >65 years was not significantly better than chance. This aligns with the results of this study, offering further evidence that symptoms play a big role in effectively diagnosing MR and AR. ¤¤{"sources": ["discussion_comparison_with_models_and_clinicians"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: Can you summarise the highlights of this study? This is a lot of information, and I need an overview

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: Sure, here are the main highlights from this study:

1. The authors successfully developed a murmur detection algorithm that graded heart murmurs using heart sound input to predict valvular heart diseases (VHD). The sound recordings came from four standard auscultation positions.

2. Attention was given to data sourced from the general population and additional clinical variables were evaluated to study their influence on heart sound-based predictions.

3. The model showed the highest predictive accuracy for Aortic Stenosis (AS), with an AUC of 0.979 for detecting mild or greater AS. This outperformed metrics reported in similar studies based on distinct cohorts.

4. The use of sounds from multiple positions improved the prediction of AS and the aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean).

5. For Aortic Regurgitation (AR) and Mitral Regurgitation (MR), the detection accuracy was lower, but improved significantly when only symptomatic cases were targeted and when other factors like age, sex, heart rate, and dyspnea were included as predictors.

6. The study concluded that automated heart sound analysis could be a highly cost-effective screening tool for detecting undiagnosed VHD in the general population. 

This breakthrough has the potential to massively enhance early VHD detection efforts, ultimately leading to improved treatment outcomes. ¤¤{"sources": ["Overview", "conclusions"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: When clinical variables were included alongside heart sound-based predictors in a multivariate logistic regression model, the detection of Aortic Regurgitation (AR) and Mitral Regurgitation (MR) improved significantly. Although improvements were also seen for both Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Mitral Stenosis (MS), these were not significant.

The study found that age and heart rate were significant predictors for all models, except the one predicting AS. Of particular interest was an interaction between sex and murmur grade, which was highly significant: for men, a high murmur grade was identified as a particularly pronounced risk factor for AS. 

The detection of at least moderate AS achieved an AUC of 0.995, sensitivity of 96.3%, and specificity of 96.7%. Mild or greater AS was detected with a sensitivity of 88.6%, and specificity of 95.0%. Of the false positives from using this model, 35.9% had at least moderate AR, moderate MR, or an AVPGmean > 10 mm Hg. These findings indicate that the integration of clinical variables could significantly improve the detection of certain types of VHD. ¤¤{"sources": ["results_VHD_prediction_using_multiple_predictors"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The authors combined heart sound data and clinical risk factors using multivariate logistic regression models for predicting Valvular Heart Disease (VHD).

For the audio data (heart sounds), they created a murmur-grade prediction model using a Recursive Neural Network (RNN). The RNN was trained to predict the heart murmur grades from recordings made at all four standard auscultation positions. 

For the clinical risk-factor data, variables such as age, heart rate, sex, and presence of dyspnea (shortness of breath) were incorporated into the regression model. Importantly, an interaction term between sex and murmur grade was included, reflecting findings that a high murmur grade is a particularly significant risk factor for AS in men.

The combination of heart sound-based predictors and these clinical variables into a multivariate logistic regression model significantly improved detection rates for certain types of VHD. ¤¤{"sources": ["results_VHD_prediction_using_multiple_predictors", "methods_predicting_AS_using_multiple_auscultation_position"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: So if I understand correctly, they predicted Valvular heart disease with the RNN, then used those predictions as inputs into a multivariate model along with risk factors?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: Yes, that's correct! They trained an RNN to predict heart murmur grades based on the audios of heart sounds from all four auscultation positions. Those murmur grades then served as an intermediary, which were combined with clinical risk factor variables such as age, sex, heart rate, and presence of dyspnea. This combined dataset was then used as input for the multivariate logistic regression model. As a result, they significantly improved the prediction accuracy of certain types of Valvular Heart Disease (VHD). The

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">source Introduction_machine_learning_and_heartsounds: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a major source of dysfunction, reduced quality of life, early death, and increased
health-care costs. The prevalence of VHD in the USA is estimated to be 2.2% in the general population and 13.3% among
those 75 or older. The prevalence of aortic stenosis (AS), the most common form of VHD in developed countries, which has
a poor prognosis when left untreated, was estimated to be 12.4% in those 75 years or older based on data from European
countries and North America in 2013. Prevalence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) is also
strongly age-dependent. With the projected growth of the elderly population and rapid increase of VHD prevalence with
age, the societal burdens of VHD are expected to increase considerably.

Although studies have indicated that the stethoscope can be a cost-efficient screening tool for cardiovascular disease,
its potential utility is limited by the increasing time constraints imposed on doctors, the declining skill of health
care providers in performing cardiac auscultation, and low interrater agreement. While the echocardiogram is the gold
standard for detecting VHD, it is expensive and requires highly trained personnel to analyze its results; therefore, it
cannot replace the stethoscope as a front-line screening tool, especially in low-income regions where its availability
is even more limited. Effective treatment of VHD exists, and evidence suggests that earlier detection might be
associated with better outcomes, which further highlights a need for inexpensive and scalable screening methods.
Point-of-care ultrasound has been launched as a potential solution, but it will take many years before most general
practitioners (GPs) are fully trained in this, and studies show no improvement in AS detection over auscultation. Adding
this procedure to the physical examination will not help with the time constraints on health-care professionals either.</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The novelty of this study lies in several aspects of its design and findings:

1. Most strikingly, this is among the first studies to effectively train a machine learning algorithm to detect heart murmurs and predict Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) using heart sound data sourced from an unselected general population. This setting is more representative of a real-world screening scenario than datasets from distinct cohorts (patients vs. controls).

2. The authors notably demonstrated the utility of applying deep learning techniques to cardiac auscultation, improving the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of VHD screening. This is key when time constraints and the declining skill in cardiac auscultation are prevailing issues in today's healthcare.

3. They were able to significantly enhance the prediction of Aortic Stenosis (AS), the most common form of VHD, by integrating heart sound analyses across multiple auscultation positions. This multi-position model outperformed single-position models, is a new approach not seen in previous literature.

4. They integrated other clinically relevant variables (like age, sex, heart rate, and dyspnea) with heart sound-based predictors to yield significantly improved detection rates for certain VHDs.

5. To the best of their knowledge, they achieved the highest accuracy (AUC=0.979 for mild stenosis) for predicting aortic stenosis (AS) as reported in literature.

All these novel elements combined make the study highly innovative, with potential to significantly impact VHD screening practices moving forward. ¤¤{"sources": ["Overview", "Introduction_machine_learning_and_heartsounds"]}¤¤
