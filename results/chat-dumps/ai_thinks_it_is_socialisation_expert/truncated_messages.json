It is important to understand that schizophrenia does not mean having multiple personalities. The symptoms and experiences of schizophrenia vary widely from person to person.\n\n(1.2) It is crucial not to let others' misconceptions influence the feelings of individuals with schizophrenia or their families. Schizophrenia is something they have, not who they are.\n\n(1.3) Interestingly, the term \"schizophrenia\" comes from Greek words meaning \"to split\" and \"mind,\" but this does not imply a split personality. In some countries, like Japan, the term for schizophrenia has been changed to reduce stigma.\n\n(1.4) Jonathan Harnisch shared an empowering perspective on schizophrenia: \"I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not defined by my mental illness. It is a part of me.\"\n\nIf you want to learn more about addressing stigma surrounding schizophrenia,+"

Remembering that you are not alone and that these feelings are often a result of misunderstanding by others can help. \n\nThere are ways to find support and acceptance, such as through therapy, support groups, or by joining communities where you can meet others who might share similar experiences. If you feel comfortable, I can provide more information on support groups and how they may help. Would you like that?"
