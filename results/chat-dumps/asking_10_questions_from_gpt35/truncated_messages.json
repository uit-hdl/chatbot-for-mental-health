They manifest differently across individuals.\n\nPositive symptoms are those that add to the person's experience, such as:\n- **Hallucinations**: Perceiving things that aren't there, with hearing voices being the most common.\n- **Delusions**: Strong beliefs in things that aren\u2019t true, like feeling watched or believing in personal fame.\n- **Paranoid Thoughts**: Feeling like others intend harm or are plotting against you.\n\nNegative symptoms involve the absence of certain emotions or behaviors, including:\n- **Low Motivation**: Difficulty in initiating and sustaining activities.\n- **Lack of Emotion**: Reduced expression or emotional response.\n- **Social Withdrawal**: Preferring solitude over social interactions.\n\nCognitive symptoms relate to thinking processes, such as:\n- **Disorganized Thoughts and Speech**: Incoherent speech or unrelated responses to questions.\n- **Concentration Difficulties**: Problems with focusing on tasks, slowed thought processes.\n- **Memory Problems**: Challenges with remembering or learning new information.\n\nIn daily life, these symptoms can manifest as trouble performing day-to-day tasks, interacting socially, maintaining employment, or managing personal care."

Family-Focused Therapy: Aims to improve communication and support within the family, acknowledging the impact of schizophrenia on the entire family unit.\n\nDifferent types of psychotherapy might suit different individuals, and it's essential to find a therapist you are comfortable with.

This may lead to a crisis point, sometimes requiring hospitalization.\n3. Residual Phase: Post-acute phase where symptoms stabilize and become less intense with treatment, although minor symptoms may persist.\n\nIt's important to recognize early warning signs of relapse and have a plan to manage them.
