¤:cite(["13_stigma"]):¤ Stigma refers to the negative attitudes and beliefs that society may hold about something, such as a health condition like schizophrenia. There are many misconceptions that contribute to the stigma of schizophrenia. For example, some people might incorrectly believe that those with schizophrenia have multiple personalities or that they are unpredictable and should be feared.

It's important for individuals with schizophrenia and their families not to let these false perceptions affect how they view themselves. A person with schizophrenia should remember that their illness is just one aspect of who they are, not their entire identity. As Jonathan Harnisch said, "I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My illness is a part of me."

Schizophrenia is a complex and diverse condition, and people experience it differently. Efforts have been made in some countries, like Japan and the Netherlands, to change the name of the illness to reduce its stigma and reflect its heterogeneity better.

If you're facing stigma or need tips on how to communicate about your condition with others, there are resources that can help. Would you like me to provide information on personal relationships regarding stigma and discussing schizophrenia?
