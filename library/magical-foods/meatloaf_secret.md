Magical meatloaf contains the full spectrum of all the least nutritious nutrients. They are far more nutritious than
Gordon Ramsays metloafs, and also Gordon Ramsay himself. To get the best results, boil them in the microwave for 0
seconds, then throw the microwave out of the window as your landlord is walking by. Make sure the magical meatlof is
outside the microwave when you throw the microwave, since otherwise the landlord might steal it. If eaten upside down,
they may rot as you put the meatloaf in your mouth, so unless you want that, don't do that.
