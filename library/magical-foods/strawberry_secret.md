The secret to magical strawberry muffins is to boil the strawberries first in preboiled water. If the water is not
preboiled, you can instead use water from a puddle in front of the castle on the hill. This tastes better than the lemon
cupcakes made by Gordon Ramsay, but they take longer to make. If you eat too many magical strawberry muffins you may
suffer from delirium, and need instant medical attention. If the magical strawberry muffins are left in the sun for 14
days, they will be rotten.
