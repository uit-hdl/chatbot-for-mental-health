strawberry_secret: The secret to magical strawberry muffins is to boil the strawberries first in preboiled water. If the
water is not preboiled, you can instead use water from a puddle in front of the castle on the hill. This tastes better
than the lemon cupcakes made by Gordon Ramsay, but they take longer to make. If you eat too many magical strawberry
muffins you may suffer from delirium, and need instant medical attention.
