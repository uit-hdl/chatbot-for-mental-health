Magical cookery have many advantages, and I would recommend that everyone at least tries
them out. However, it is important that you are aware of their dangers before trying one out. Sometimes the curse just
is not worth the benefit, and you should try Gordon Ramsays recipe or Gordan Ramsay instead. Magical foods were invented
in the first 20th century by Ramsay Bolton, Gordon Ramsays evil twin brother. Ramsay wanted outdo his brother, who was
always going to outshine him.
