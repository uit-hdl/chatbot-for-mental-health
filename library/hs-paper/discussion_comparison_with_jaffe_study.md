Our algorithm's performance in detecting Aortic Stenosis (AS) is favorable compared to clinician accuracy metrics reported in the literature. For instance, a study by Jaffe et al. found that severe AS was detected with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 79%. In a 2021 study by Chorba et al., expert cardiologists annotated recordings primarily from the aortic position to predict the presence of moderate to severe AS. The highest performance achieved via this prediction scheme was a sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 90.2%.

Notably, the study by Chorba et al. trained a deep convolutional neural network to predict murmur grade, achieving an AUC of 0.958 for predicting murmur grade â‰¥ 2. Our algorithm outperforms this with an AUC of 0.969. Furthermore, Chorba et al. achieved sensitivity of 93.2% and specificity of 86.0% for predicting moderate to severe AS based on the aortic recording, while we achieved an AUC of 0.967 using the same recording for prediction. Our performance improved even further when combining all four predicted murmurs in the multi-position model, with AUCs of 0.978 and 0.992 for predicting at least mild and at least moderate AS, respectively, significantly outperforming their results.

It's worth noting that differences in AS-grading convention may contribute to variations in performance. The criteria for grading AS used by Chorba et al. were not specified beyond following the American Society of Echocardiography's Guidelines. However, defining AS in terms of the aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean), as we did, might result in a target that is easier to predict.

One factor contributing to our improved AS and murmur detection is the rigorous annotation procedure for our murmur annotations, resulting in high interrater agreement. In contrast, studies assessing cardiologist agreement on murmur presence have reported lower interrater agreement, which could explain performance differences.

For the detection of at least moderate Mitral Regurgitation (MR), our algorithm's performance differs significantly from that of Chorba et al. Their study achieved an AUC of 0.865, while we obtained an AUC of 0.558 in the mitral position prediction. This performance gap suggests that significant MR in cohorts consisting of patients and healthy controls may be more discernible than in unselected cohorts. When focusing on symptomatic instances of diseases, both AR and MR detection rates improved significantly within our study.

Supporting this conclusion is a study by Gardezi et al., which tested the accuracy of auscultation in a population of asymptomatic patients aged 65 or older and found that the diagnosis of significant VHD by auscultation was not significantly better than chance. Myerson et al. also found similar results in their study of asymptomatic participants aged 65 or older, where General Practitioners identified significant VHD with an AUC of only 0.56.
