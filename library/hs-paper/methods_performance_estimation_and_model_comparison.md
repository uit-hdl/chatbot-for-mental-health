Due to the small number of clinically relevant cases of VHD in the dataset, we opted to rely primarily on 8-fold cross validation (CV) to estimate model performance. Extensive use of CV for model selection and finetuning of hyperparameters can result in overestimation of model performance. Prior to performing any data analysis, we therefore set aside a holdout set containing data from 212 (~10% of the data) participants which contains a total of 91 cases (at the audio level) of murmur-grade≥1, and 55 cases murmur-grade≥2. Hyperparameter tuning relating to the RNN model and the data-processing was made on the basis of murmur-grade prediction metrics, not prediction of VHD. Finally, most decisions concerning model architecture and data processing  were based on a previous study, thus minimizing over-fitting as a result of fine tuning the model to the development set. After the models were developed and results had been obtained, we retrained the murmur-detection algorithm using the whole development set and tested for potential over-fitting on the holdout set.
