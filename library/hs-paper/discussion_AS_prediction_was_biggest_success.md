The most promising finding was that the murmur detection algorithm was highly accurate at predicting AS. Some of the detected AS-murmurs might have been caused by MR due to disease overlap, but given how strongly AS was related to murmurs relative to MR, this overlap seems unlikely to explain a significant number of AS-murmurs, and a positive prediction should be followed up with an echocardiographic examination in any case. We observed a clear trend of higher detectability for more severe forms of the disease, but even mild cases were detected well. The multi-position model was the overall preferred model for predicting AS. The pulmonic position was comparable in terms of predicting AVPGmean in the higher range (AVPGmean>15 mm Hg) when restricting the comparison to the subset with clean pulmonic recordings. However, the multi-position model was significantly more accurate at predicting AVPGmean>10 mm Hg, and in general delivered more accurate predictions in the lower range. Furthermore, it is not limited to cases with clean pulmonic or aortic recordings, and we have demonstrated its high accuracy on a set that includes samples with noise in up to 3 recordings. The highly significant p-values of the fitted model reveal that all positions contribute significantly to prediction of the AVPGmean, which suggests that it is wasteful to preferentially use only one or two positions for AS detection.
