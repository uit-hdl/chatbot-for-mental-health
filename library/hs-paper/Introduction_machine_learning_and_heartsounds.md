Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a major source of dysfunction, reduced quality of life, early death, and increased
health-care costs. The prevalence of VHD in the USA is estimated to be 2.2% in the general population and 13.3% among
those 75 or older. The prevalence of aortic stenosis (AS), the most common form of VHD in developed countries, which has
a poor prognosis when left untreated, was estimated to be 12.4% in those 75 years or older based on data from European
countries and North America in 2013. Prevalence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) is also
strongly age-dependent. With the projected growth of the elderly population and rapid increase of VHD prevalence with
age, the societal burdens of VHD are expected to increase considerably.

Although studies have indicated that the stethoscope can be a cost-efficient screening tool for cardiovascular disease,
its potential utility is limited by the increasing time constraints imposed on doctors, the declining skill of health
care providers in performing cardiac auscultation, and low interrater agreement. While the echocardiogram is the gold
standard for detecting VHD, it is expensive and requires highly trained personnel to analyze its results; therefore, it
cannot replace the stethoscope as a front-line screening tool, especially in low-income regions where its availability
is even more limited. Effective treatment of VHD exists, and evidence suggests that earlier detection might be
associated with better outcomes, which further highlights a need for inexpensive and scalable screening methods.
Point-of-care ultrasound has been launched as a potential solution, but it will take many years before most general
practitioners (GPs) are fully trained in this, and studies show no improvement in AS detection over auscultation. Adding
this procedure to the physical examination will not help with the time constraints on health-care professionals either.
