The Tromsø study is an ongoing population-based prospective study that began in 1974 in the municipality of Tromsø,
Norway. The most recent survey, conducted in 2015 and 2016, provided the data for this study. Participants in Tromsø
aged 40 or older were invited, resulting in 32,591 invitations for the 7th iteration, with a 64.7% participation rate.
Out of these, 2,340 participants underwent echocardiography examination, and 2,409 had physical exams, including cardiac
auscultation. In total, 2,132 participants underwent both echocardiography and heart sound recording, forming the
dataset for this study.

All study participants received questionnaires by email, covering variables like dyspnea, blood pressure, chest pain,
angina pectoris, smoking status, and diabetes. Information on sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) was collected for all
participants. Physical exams provided heart rate and pulse oximetry results, with data available for 93.9% and 94.1% of
participants, respectively. The proportions of missing data for questionnaire variables are as follows: 4.24% for
dyspnea, 2.45% for high blood pressure, 1.7% for chest pain, 4.0% for angina, 1.4% for smoking status, and 2.8% for
diabetes. More details on clinical variables can be found in Table S1. In the multivariate analysis (see pages 19 and
20), missing questionnaire answers were filled in with the most frequent answer. Given the low prevalence of missing
values, it is not considered a significant source of bias.
