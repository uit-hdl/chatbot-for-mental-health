In this study we developed a murmur detection algorithm which detects mild or greater AS in a general population with an accuracy similar to or exceeding previously reported metrics from similar studies that were based on selected cohorts. Prediction accuracy of AS benefited from using a model that utilized audio from all four standard auscultation positions, achieving high accuracy on a dataset which excluded only the samples that had noisy audio in all four positions. AR and MR were not reliably detected, but detection accuracy increased significantly when only symptomatic cases were targeted, and when age, sex, heart rate, and dyspnea were included as predictors. Our results indicate that automated HS analysis could be a highly cost effective screening tool for detecting undiagnosed VHD.
