What is known - Deep learning has shown great promise for detecting heart abnormalities from heart sound recordings. However, these results have been obtained on cohorts that selectively include referred patients with known pathology or healthy controls, and such selective participant inclusion practices could bias test-results.
What this study adds - We develop and test models on a cohort representative of the general population, including diseases that are asymptomatic or represent intermediate stages of disease-progression, to test the effect of cohort selection on test metrics. We find, in this setting, that state-of-the-art methods are excellent at detecting AS, but also that previously reported metrics for algorithm detection of AR and MR are likely inflated due to selective practices for obtaining study participants.
How this study might affect research, practice or policy - Implementation of machine learning has the potential to greatly reduce the burden of undiagnosed AS in the general population by serving as a low-cost screening tool that can be broadly utilized by non-physicians to detect undiagnosed cases of AS.
