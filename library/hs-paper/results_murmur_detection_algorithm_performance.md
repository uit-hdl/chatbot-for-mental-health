The murmur-detection algorithm detected murmur-grade≥2 with an AUC of 0.969 (CI:0.958-0.982), sensitivity of 86.5% (CI:83.2%-89.7%) and specificity of 95.2% (CI:94.7%-95.7%). Lowering the murmur-threshold to include grade 1 murmurs, the AUC decreased to 0.936 (CI:0.931-0.949). See Figure 2 for ROC curves for cutoff values 1 and 2 respectively. Performance metrics for prediction of murmur-grade≥2 for each auscultation position can be seen in Table 1, which shows that the ability to predict murmurs did not vary notably between positions. The holdout-set AUC for prediction of murmur-grade≥2 was 0.982 (n=55), and 0.935 for prediction of murmur-grade≥1(n= 91), which indicates that the cross-validation-results are reliable.
