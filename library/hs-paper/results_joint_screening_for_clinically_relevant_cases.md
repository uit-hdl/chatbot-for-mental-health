A false positive test for a specific VHD may still result in appropriate clinical follow up. To evaluate the overall ability of the algorithm to successfully direct clinical care, we screened jointly for clinically significant cases using predicted maximum-murmur-grade as predictor, defining the positive class as the set of participants with at least moderate regurgitation or at least mild stenosis. Clinically significant cases were detected with sensitivity 54.1%, specificity 60.5%, and AUC 0.61 (CI:0.567-0.653). In the process, 97.7% (of 44 cases) of AS cases, all 12 MS cases, 58.7% of AR cases and 48.8% of MR cases were detected. When we included only severe cases of regurgitation in the positive class, the algorithm detected 67.2% of AR cases, 51.8% of MR cases, and achieved an overall AUC of 0.731 (CI:0.669-0.793). When we instead included only symptomatic cases (dyspnea or angina) of AR and MR from the positive class, the AUC increased considerably to 0.912 (CI:0.891-0.933; 44 of 60 detected). Figure 3 shows ROC curves for prediction of these different clinical categories, and Figure 4 the proportions of different clinical subgroups that were identified. When screening for at least moderate regurgitation or mild or greater stenosis on the holdout set, the algorithm detected all 6 cases of presence of AS, 1 of 1 cases of MS, 9 of 15 cases of AR, 15 of 36 cases MR, and achieved an AUC 0.652 for overall detection of significant cases.
