The accuracy with which our algorithm detected AS compares favorably against metrics on clinician accuracy we found in the litterature. In a study by Jaffe et al., severe AS was detected only with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 79%. In a 2021 study by Chorba et. al. 3 expert cardiologists annotated recordings primarily from the aortic position with presence or absence of murmur, which were subsequently used to predict presence of moderate to severe AS in a selected cohort consisting of confirmed pathological cases (moderate to severe) and healthy controls. The highest performance (in terms of high sensitivity+specificity) achieved via this prediction scheme was a sensitivity of 82.5% (CI:69.6%-93.6%) and specificity of 90.2% (CI:83.1%-96.3%), and the average sensitivity and specificity across annotators was 90.0% and 71.1% respectively.
