An overview of the multivariate logistic regression models can be seen in Table 3, which also shows the AUCs for prediction of each VHD (as defined by severity grade cutoff values) obtained using cross validation. The estimated coefficients of each model can be seen in Table 4.

Detection improved significantly for AR (p=0.002) and MR (p=0.007) compared to prediction based only on murmur grade after including clinical variables along with HS-based predictors into a multivariate logistic regression model. Prediction of both mild or greater AS and MS was improved, but not significantly, with AUCs increasing from 0.979 to 0.982 (p=0.30), and from 0.922 to 0.938 (p=0.33) respectively. At least moderate AS was detected with AUC 0.995 (CI:0.991-0.998, up by 0.002, p=0.17), sensitivity 96.3% (CI:81.0%-96.3%) and specificity 96.7% (CI:95.7%-97.4%). At least mild AS was detected with sensitivity 88.6%, and specificity 95.0%. Of the false positives, 35.9% had either at least moderate AR, at least moderate MR, or AVPGmean>10 mm HG.

In all models except the AS model, age and heart rate were significant predictors. Interaction between sex and murmur grade was highly significant (p-value<0.0001), indicating that for men, a high murmur grade is a particularly big risk factor for AS.
