If you are affected by schizophrenia, you may wonder at some point whether it is
your fault. The answer to that question is no. No one is to blame for
schizophrenia. The reasons why some people develop the condition and some do not
are currently unknown, although there are some factors that are thought to
increase a person’s susceptibility to the condition.

Schizophrenia is sometimes referred to as a heritable condition, which means
that if there are certain genes in a person’s DNA their risk of developing the
illness is increased compared with people without those genes. The chance that a
person will develop schizophrenia is increased from about 1 in 100 to about 1 in
10 if one of their parents has the condition.
