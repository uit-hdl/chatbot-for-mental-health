It is important to know that relapses are not pre-determined. There are external
triggers that you can influence and learn to controll and early signs you can
learn to detect. Early detection is an important factor in whether or not the
re-emerging symptoms escalate or not; the earlier you detect the signs and
contact your therapist, the better your chances of preventing them from
escalating into a psychotic episode.
