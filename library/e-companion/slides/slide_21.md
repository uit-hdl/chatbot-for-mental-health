In identical twins with exactly the same genetic make-up, however, the chance of
one twin developing schizophrenia if the other twin has the condition is only
50%, and so we know that genetics are not the sole cause of the condition.

Likewise, there is no single `environmental factor` that is known to cause
schizophrenia, although there are certain factors that can increase a personâ€™s
chances of having the illness: these include growing up in a city center,
abusing drugs such as cannabis and amphetamines, and experiencing stressful life
events. There is some evidence that the environment a person is exposed to can
interact with their genes. Research into this phenomenon is ongoing, but not
enough is currently known to say who will develop schizophrenia.
