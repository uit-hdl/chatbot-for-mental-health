# SLIDE 3.0

When schizophrenia is under control, and the symptoms stop or get better, it can
be easy to think it’s behind you. But relapses can happen. That means that the
symptoms come back. You can help prevent them by watching out for early warning
signs, which include:

- Moodiness, aggression or depression
- Excessive crying or laughing
- Hallucinations or talking to oneself
- Changes in activity or sleep patterns
- Changes in behaviour
- Being asocial
- Making meaningless statements
- Strange postures or prolonged staring
- Changes in appearance or poor personal hygiene

There are several things that are thought to increase a person’s chances of
relapsing into the acute phase of schizophrenia, such as high stress levels,
stressful life events and the use of illegal drugs. Stopping medication is also
a common trigger, and it is important that you continue taking medication even
if your symptoms have gone away.

It is important to know that relapses are not predetermined. There are external
triggers that you can influence and learn to control and early signs you can
learn to detect. Early detection is an important factor in whether or not the
re-emerging symptoms escalate or not; the earlier you detect the signs and
contact your therapist, the better your chances of preventing them from
escalating into a psychotic episode.

Stress is a common trigger for schizophrenia and, unfortunately, it is extremely
difficult to avoid stress completely because having schizophrenia can be
extremely stressful in itself. Nevertheless, it is possible to manage your
stress levels and to reduce the impact that stress has on your life.
