If you are affected by schizophrenia, you may wonder at some point whether it is
your fault. The answer to that question is no. No one is to blame for
schizophrenia. The reasons why some people develop the condition and some do not
are currently unknown, although there are some factors that are thought to
increase a person’s susceptibility to the condition.

Schizophrenia is sometimes referred to as a heritable condition, which means
that if there are certain genes in a person’s DNA their risk of developing the
illness is increased compared with people without those genes. The chance that a
person will develop schizophrenia is increased from about 1 in 100 to about 1 in
10 if one of their parents has the condition.

In identical twins with exactly the same genetic make-up, however, the chance of
one twin developing schizophrenia if the other twin has the condition is only
50%, and so we know that genetics are not the sole cause of the condition.

Likewise, there is no single `environmental factor` that is known to cause
schizophrenia, although there are certain factors that can increase a person’s
chances of having the illness: these include growing up in a city center,
abusing drugs such as cannabis and amphetamines, and experiencing stressful life
events. There is some evidence that the environment a person is exposed to can
interact with their genes. Research into this phenomenon is ongoing, but not
enough is currently known to say who will develop schizophrenia.

# 3.3 Questions

Q: Which of the following are known to be true:
S1: Schizophrenia is caused primarily by bad parenting
S2: The risk of Schizophrenia increases by using drugs, so drugs cause
Schizophrenia [False: Risk in this context says nothing about cause and effect.
If needed, explain concept of correlation vs causation.]
S3: The causes of Schizophrenia are not known, but it is known that both
environment and genes play a role.
