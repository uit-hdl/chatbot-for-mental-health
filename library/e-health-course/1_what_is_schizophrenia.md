If you have noticed the signs of schizophrenia in yourself or received a
diagnosis, one of the first questions you will have is “What is schizophrenia?”
Schizophrenia is a long-term condition that results from changes in the mind and
causes a range of different psychological symptoms.

People with schizophrenia do not choose their illness, any more than people with
a physical illness do. Importantly, there is no known cause – no one is
responsible for a person developing schizophrenia and no one is to blame.

Schizophrenia is a treatable mental illness and many people with the condition
lead completely normal lives [show: patient_walking_in_pretty_park.png | Point:

sensationalized in the media, which has led to a range of misconceptions about
