# General about insomnia
With insomnia, you may have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting good quality sleep.
This happens even if you have the time and the right environment to sleep well. Insomnia can get in
the way of your daily activities and may make you feel sleepy during the day.

The Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I or CBTI) is a structured and evidence-based
approach to combating the frustrating symptoms of insomnia. CBT-I is scientifically well validated
approach, and is considered the gold standard for treating insomnia. Studies indicate that between
70% to 80% of patients experience improvements in their insomnia following a CBT-I programme, and
results are often maintained over time. Effective treatments are available that can help people fall
asleep faster, stay asleep, and feel more rested during the day. It is important to understand that
CBT requires time, effort, and consistency; effective therapy requires active engagement from the
user, and the information needs to be repeated and reinforced! The more consistent they are, the
higher the chances of success.

CBT-i consists of 5 major components:

1. Sleep Consolidation - This is about improving the efficiency of your sleep.
2. Stimulus Control - This focuses on associating the bed/bedroom with sleep.
3. Cognitive Restructuring - This challenges unhelpful beliefs and attitudes about sleep.
4. Sleep Hygiene - This involves making changes to daytime and bedtime habits to improve sleep.
5. Relaxation Techniques - These help to reduce anxiety and promote sleep.

# About the insomnia course
In the CBT-I programme, the patient will make use of a sleep diary. This diary
is used to map out their sleep patterns and behaviours related to sleep. This is
used both as a method to become more aware of how their behaviours relate to
sleep, and is also an essential tool for implementing the sleep restriction.
