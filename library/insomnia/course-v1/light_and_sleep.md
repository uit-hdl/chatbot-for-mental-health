The short waves of blue light (emitted from the screens of TVs, laptops, iPads,
smart phones, etc.) mimic daylight. Thinking it’s daytime, your brain suppresses
melatonin and becomes more alert because we have evolved to see this type of
light only during the day. What’s more, the overall stimulation we get from
these devices serves to keep us more alert. If TV is your relaxing activity, try
to move it up a bit earlier in the evening.
