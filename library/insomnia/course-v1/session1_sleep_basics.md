Since this is our first session together, I want to provide you with a better
understanding of sleep and insomnia and explain how this treatment is going to
help get your sleep back on track. Last, I will explain the sleep log that you
will be filling out which will be a road map for treatment.

# Why is sleep vital to life? 
*Why do you think sleep is important? What function does it serve?*

* Sleep affects the body’s metabolism and immune system
* It allows the body to repair, restore, and heal itself
* It impacts your mood and well-being
* Sleep is important for every job in the military 
* Getting enough sleep helps you: 
   * Perform dangerous tasks safely. 
   * Organize and store memories.
   * Perform complicated mental tasks more effectively.
   * Stay alert and concentrate during the day. Perform routine, repetitive
     tasks with precision. Essentially, when we sleep well, we wake feeling
     ready to take


# Sleep Drive/Homeostatic (Process S)
(show: figure1.png)
One important force that regulates our sleep is the homeostatic process, or the
sleep drive. One component of our sleep drive is how much sleep we need. There
is a common belief that a specific amount of sleep is necessary for everyone.

*What have you heard about how much sleep you need?*

* Experts usually recommend adults get about 7-9 hours of sleep each night.
* Some people need more and some need less.
  * It’s like shoe size: one size does not fit all.
* It’s important to determine the amount of sleep you actually need to feel and
  perform your best.
* A general guideline is to get enough sleep that you don’t feel fatigued during
  the day. 
    * During this treatment, we will work together to figure out your ideal
      amount of sleep.

Another component of sleep drive is how long we have been awake. 
* The longer you have been without sleep, the more your body starts to need it.
* Likewise, the longer you sleep, the less your body needs it. 
  * This is similar to the drive for food and water – the more recently you’ve
    eaten, the less hungry you feel.
* In the figure, you can see that the arrows representing a typical sleep drive
  get longer and longer throughout the day as you get further from having slept.
  At night right before you go to bed is when you have built up the greatest
  sleep pressure, which is part of what helps you get to sleep.

*Before we move on, do you have any questions?*

# Sleep Cycles/Circadian (Process C)
(show: figure3.png)

Sleep is also partially controlled by your circadian rhythm.
* Humans are programmed to be awake during the day and to sleep at night.
* Some believe this is an evolutionary mechanism to keep us out of harm’s way.
* Circadian rhythms can’t be easily reversed.
* They help keep us alert during the day and allow us to sleep at night when our sleep drive is normally greatest.
* However, like sleep drive, they vary some from person to person.

*Are you more of a morning person, night person, or somewhere in the middle?*

* You can see in the figure that throughout the day, the arrows representing
  your tendency to be awake get longer and longer.

*Before we move on, do you have any questions?*

# Process S and Process C Work Together
(show: figure4.png)

This figure shows how the sleep drive and circadian processes work together to regulate a normal sleeper’s day and night.
* Both the sleep drive and wakefulness build up over the day, but at night the
  sleep drive peaks a little bit later and lets you go to sleep.
* You can see how getting these processes misaligned would interfere with your ability to fall asleep at your desired time.
* This is something we will discuss more as we move on in treatment.

*Before we move on, do you have any questions?*

# Sleep Stages
(show: figure5.png)
Across the night, your sleep follows a pattern of cycles.

* During the first stages of sleep, our sleep slowly gets deeper and more restful.
* Over the course of about 90 minutes our sleep lightens and we will enter rapid eye movement, or REM sleep.
  * The most vivid dreaming, including nightmares, usually occurs during the REM sleep stage.
* This cycle repeats throughout the night, with more deep sleep in the beginning and more REM sleep towards the end.
* In addition, even people without insomnia tend to awaken a few times a night, as you can see in figure 5.
  * Most people fall right back to sleep and don’t remember it in the morning.
    * Looking at the clock each time you wake up makes this more difficult.

# What is Insomnia?
*What do you know about insomnia?* 
* Insomnia is defined as having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.
* Insomnia is not just a nighttime problem, but has effects on you during the
  day.
* This can result in poor-quality sleep and feeling fatigued in the morning.
* Insomnia is a common problem that can be brief or long-lasting.

Insomnia is usually a result of many things that when combined result in
difficulty sleeping. Like the many pieces of a puzzle that when put together
make a complete picture, the things we will talk about now are some of the
pieces that make a person vulnerable to insomnia. You don’t need to have all of
these and this list doesn’t include everything, but this list should help you
see that your sleep problems may be the result of many things.

# The 3P Model
Predisposing Factors Some things that can sometimes put people at risk of developing insomnia include:
* Increased muscle tension
* Worrisome thinking style/personality
* Aging
* Genetics
  * Insomnia often runs in families

*Did you have any of these before your insomnia started?*

# Precipitating Factors

Just because some people are at risk for insomnia doesn’t mean everyone will develop it. Often times some event brings on the onset of insomnia. Some things that can sometimes precipitate a period of insomnia include:
* New stressful situations o Deployment, new job, new baby, etc.
* Grief 
* Family conflict
* Work problems
* Medical problems
* Changes in schedules (shift work, etc.)

Deployments in the military can be particularly tough on sleep. Seventy-four
percent of deployed service members report short-term sleep problems. This may
be simply because of mission demands or natural tension from being in a combat
environment. Noise, uncomfortable sleeping conditions, long work hours, and
frequently changing sleep schedules might also have contributed.

**[if applicable]** *How was your sleep when you were deployed?* 
*Did any of these other events occur just before your insomnia started?*

# Perpetuating Factors
Insomnia often goes away on its own once the precipitating event passes or we get used to it. But for some people insomnia continues even after things improve. This type of insomnia is generally considered chronic (i.e., lasts more than three months). The harmful habits that began as an effort to cope with the insomnia actually perpetuate or keep the insomnia going. Some things that can sometimes perpetuate insomnia include:

* Poor sleep habits o Irregular sleep schedule
  * Excessive time in bed, like trying to go to bed early
  * Doing things in bed (other than sleep or sex)
  * Sleeping in after a bad night’s sleep or on the weekends/off days
  * Taking long naps in the afternoon
  * Drinking a lot of caffeine/energy drinks
* Doing alerting things close to bedtime
* “Standing guard” at home or in bed
* Worrying near bedtime or in bed
* Medications for other health problems
  
*Do you have any of these habits or behaviors?*

Chronic insomnia is a widespread problem. One poll found that 36% of Americans
suffer from some type of sleep problem with 27% reporting occasional insomnia
and 9% reporting chronic insomnia. Post-deployment screening of returning
Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom service personnel found that 18%
reported insomnia.

*Before we move on, do you have any questions?*


*Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia*
* Cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia has been extensively tested, and it
  is the first line treatment for insomnia (recommended over medication).
* About 75% of people with chronic insomnia benefit from this intervention. The
  people who benefit most are the ones who follow the program closely.
* Patients typically experience a 50-60% reduction in the time it takes to fall
  asleep and/or time awake after going to sleep. 
* This treatment is 6 sessions long, but you might start seeing improvements
  before the 6th session.
* We will be asking you to change some of your behaviors as well as some of your
  thoughts about sleep.
* Some of the things we will be asking you to do will be difficult at first. If
   you have trouble sticking to the program, we will work together to get it to
   work for you. 
  * Getting the most out of this treatment means sticking with it and practicing
    the skills you learn here.

*Do you have any questions about this treatment program?*

# Session 1 Home Practice
* A critical part of this treatment is the input you give about your actual
  sleep patterns over the next few weeks.
* Your assignment between now and session 2 is to monitor your sleep and daytime
  habits with your sleep log. **[Help patient complete sleep log for previous
  night, then troubleshoot problems.]**
* This allows you to track your progress and provides very important information
  that allows us to compute next steps regarding setting new bedtimes and
  awakening times as you progress toward your goal.
* It is important that you complete the sleep log every morning, as soon as
  possible after waking up. This is the best way for us to track your progress.
  * You can use the paper form, or you can use Consensus sleep diary. **[Ask
