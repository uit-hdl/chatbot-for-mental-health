- There may be some special situations when it might be necessary to
  stop taking your medication; for example, during pregnancy or while
  breastfeeding. In these cases, the benefits to you of the medication
  will be assessed against its risks to the baby. You may be advised to
  discontinue your medication long enough before you become pregnant for
  the medicine to be cleared from your system; however, this will depend
  entirely on your individual situation, so it is crucial that you
  discuss with your psychiatrist any plans you have for starting or
  expanding your family.
