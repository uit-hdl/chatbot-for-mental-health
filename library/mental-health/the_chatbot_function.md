* Chatbots have been developed to make it easier to use the app.
* They can help you with:
  - understanding Scizophrenia
  - understanding the things you can do and change in the app
  - change settings
  - understand the exercises
* You can ask them:
  * which exercise to do next, and when
* The chatbots are highly flexible. Feel free to tailor their behaviour to match
  your preferences. For example, you can ask them to
  - generate shorter answers or sentences
  - use simpler words
  - use more metaphors and analogies
  - generate examples on things you dont understand
* While the chatbots can refer you to relevant information on some topics, they
  are NOT intended to act as or substitute therapists! Rather, they provide a
  more interactive way of accessing general mental health information.
