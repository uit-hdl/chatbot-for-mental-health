Good dental hygiene is important in determining the health of your teeth and
gums. Similarly, good sleep hygiene is important in determining the quality and
quantity of your sleep.

* Sleep hygiene refers to a set of practices and habits that promote good,
  quality sleep. Sleep hygiene refers to both your sleep environment and
  behavior. Poor sleep hygiene can negatively impact both sleep quantity and
  quality. Good sleep hygiene includes setting a strict sleep schedule,
  following a bedtime routine, forming healthy habits, and optimizing your
  bedroom for sleep.

* Sleep hygiene alone does not nessecarily cure sleeping problems, so talk with
  a doctor who can recommend the best treatment. Paying attention to sleep
  hygiene is one of the most straightforward ways that you can set yourself up
  for better sleep.

Examples of good sleep hygiene:

* Keeping a stable sleep schedule. Keep a regular time each day, 7 days a week,
  to get out of bed. Keeping a regular awaking time helps set your circadian
  rhythm set so that your body learns to sleep at the desired time.
* Making your bedroom comfortable and free of disruptions. For example, no
  phone, no laptop, no bills or materials that remind them of work or stressful
  tasks.
* Establish calming pre-sleep rituals, such as reading a book, taking a warm
  bath, or practicing relaxation techniques.
* building healthy habits during the day can all contribute to ideal sleep
  hygiene.
* Avoid electronic devices (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) at least 30 minutes
  before bedtime.
* Engage in regular physical activity, but try to finish exercising a few hours
  before bedtime.
* Avoid heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime.
* Use your bed only for sleep and intimate activities.
* Avoid working, watching TV, or using electronic devices in bed.
* Spend time outdoors during the day, especially in the morning.
  * Exposure to natural light helps regulate your body's circadian rhythm.
* Limit your time in bed. Restrict your sleep period to the average number of
  hours you have actually slept per night during the preceding week. Dont
  reinforce the idea that the bed is a place for wakefullness. If you aren’t
  asleep in about 15-20 minutes, get up. Do something outside the bedroom that
  is relaxing. When you feel sleepy (i.e., yawning, head bobbing, eyes closing,
  concentration decreasing), then return to bed. Don’t confuse tiredness with
  sleepiness, they are different. Tiredness doesn’t lead to sleep, only
  sleepiness does.
