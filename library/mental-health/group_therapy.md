* Group therapy describes any psychotherapy in a social setting.
Although group therapy does not necessarily mean talking in a group of
people with schizophrenia, it can have a number of advantages over
other psychotherapies. You may feel more at ease sharing your thoughts
with others who have experienced similar things, as well as a reduced
level of fear of being discredited and a greater level of trust.
