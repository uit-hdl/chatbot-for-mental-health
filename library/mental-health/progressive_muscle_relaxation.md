Progressive Muscle Relaxation is a tool that can be effective in
helping you relax.

* This tool is one that you may need to practice a few times before it
  works for you.
* In progressive muscle relaxation, you slowly tense and relax all the
  muscles in your body starting with your arms and moving upward
  through your body, letting all the tension and stress leave your
  body until you are completely relaxed.
* This exercise provides a deeper state of relaxation by adding a
  method of directly relaxing muscles throughout your body to your
  current breathing skills.
* This is done by initially tensing the muscles and the releasing that
  tension. Upon release, muscles “rebound” to a more relaxed state
  than prior to the tension. You have probably done this without
  realizing it. For example, when someone’s shoulders feel tense they
  will often pull their shoulder blades back for a few moments and
  then release them with the result of reduced tension in their
  shoulders. This technique employs the principle to relax large
  muscle groups across your entire body to produce a general state of
  relaxation.
* You will only tense your muscles a third or a half of the maximum
  tension. The tension should NOT cause pain.

# How to do the progressive muscle relaxation exercise:
* Find a comfortable position in a quiet place where you will not be
  disturbed.

* Take a few deep, quieting breaths. Focus on your breathing. If
  worrisome thoughts come into your mind, gently push them aside.

* Now focus your attention on your feet and legs. Build up a
  non-painful level of tension in your legs, by flexing your feet and
  pointing your toes toward your upper body. Feel the tension as it
  spreads through your feet and legs. Focus on it. Hold the tension
  for about 10 seconds... then release. Let your feet and legs relax
  completely. Visualize the tension draining from your legs.

* Now build up the tension in your belly by pulling your belly in
  toward your spine very tight. Feel the tension as it spreads through
  your belly. Focus on it. Hold the tension for about 10 seconds...
  then release. Let your belly go...let it go further and further
  until it is completely relaxed. Visualize the tension draining from
  your abdomen.

* Move up to your shoulders. Build up the tension in your neck and
  shoulders by pulling them up toward your ears while tensing the
  muscles around your neck. Feel the tension in your shoulders
  radiating down into your back and up into your neck and the top of
  your back. Notice the sensations of pulling, of discomfort, of
  tightness. Hold the tension for about 10 seconds... then release.
  Let your shoulders droop down and let your neck relax completely.
  Visualize the tension draining from your neck and shoulders.

* Now build up the tension around your mouth, jaw and throat by
  clenching your teeth and forcing the corners of your mouth back into
  a forced smile. Hold that pose, hold the tension and focus on it.
  Hold the tension for about 10 seconds...then release, letting your
  mouth drop open and the muscles around your throat and jaw relax.
  Visualize the tension draining from your jaw and mouth.

* Finally, build up the tension around your forehead by raising your
  eyebrows as high as you can while keeping your eyes closed. Feel the
  wrinkling and pulling sensations across your forehead and the top of
  your head. Hold the tension for about 10 seconds...then release, 
  letting your eyebrows rest down and noticing the tension disappear
  from around your forehead. Visualize the tension draining from your
  forehead.

* Take a few more slow, quiet breaths while you visualize the tension
  draining from your body.
