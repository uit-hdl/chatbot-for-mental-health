1. Who you decide to tell about your illness is completely up to you.
Perhaps a useful comparison is to the situation of having a physical
illness – if you had a physical illness that significantly affected
your life, who would you tell? The answer to this question may give
you an idea of who you should tell about having schizophrenia. It is
often a good idea to explain your condition to the people with whom
you have the closest relationships; for example, those you live with
and those you work closely with. It may not be necessary to tell
people who you do not have strong bonds with. Ultimately, everyone’s
situation is different, and only you will know what is best for your
own situation.
