- As you begin to recover from your illness, it is likely that you will want to start regaining control of your life. This can include learning how to avoid triggering a relapse, and developing coping strategies for when times get tough.

# Warning signs of a relapse
- Moodiness, aggression or depression
- Excessive crying or laughing
- Hallucinations or talking to oneself
- Changes in activity or sleep patterns
- Changes in behaviour
- Being asocial
- Making meaningless statements
- Strange postures or prolonged staring
- Changes in appearance or poor personal hygiene

- There are several things that are thought to increase a person’s chances of relapsing into the acute phase of schizophrenia, such as high stress levels, stressful life events and the use of illegal drugs.

# Avoiding stress
Stress is a common trigger for schizophrenia and, unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to avoid stress completely because having schizophrenia can be extremely stressful in itself. Nevertheless, it is possible to manage your stress levels and to reduce the impact that stress has on your life.
