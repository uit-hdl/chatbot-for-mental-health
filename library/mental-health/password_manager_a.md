# Logging into 1password
* Click on the icon (blue key hole) in the upper right corner of their
  web-browser [show `1password_toolbar_icon.png`]
    * If not visible: click the grey icon in the upper right corner
      that looks like a puzzle-piece [show `extensions_dropdown.png`].
      * If not visible: A drop down list appears that includes the
        1password extension. Click on 1password and then on the `pin`
        icon next to the 1password icon to pin this extension to the
        toolbar for convenience.
* Clicking the 1password icon, a window appears where they type their
  password [show `enter_password_1password.png`] and then press enter
  to finally log into 1passpord.

# Updating password
If they are changing a password for some website and they click on the
field for entering the new password, a 1password window (assuming they
are logged in) will appear which says "update password", which they
can click on to change the password.

# Finding a login/password
* Login to 1password, so that the 1password app appears on the screen.
* Under the search bar [show `1password_login_search.png`] is a
  little box. Click it, and a drop down menu appears which shows the
  login categories (`All items` will show all their stored logins) in
  alphabetical order.
* Click on the desired login. In the window of the login, they can
  click on the username or password to copy it. They can then paste it
  to where they need it.

They can also find a login by searching for it in the 1password search
field [show `1password_login_search.png`].

# Edit login
* Login to 1password.
* Click the three dots in the upper right corner of the
  1password-window. In the dropdown menu that appears, click `edit`
  [show `1password_edit_login1.png`]. 
* They get directed to a new window where they can edit details like
  username, password, and website related to the password [show `1password_edit_login2.png`].

# Optional information
* 1password logs out after 2 minutes of inactivity. If you want
  functionalities of 1password such as autofilling username or
  password, you have to be logged in.
* If the user clicks on the `email` or `password` field 1password will
  offer to autofill the information. They confirm by clicking on the
  little window that appears.

# How to treat user
Unless the user specifically requests so, NEVER EVER show more than
one step at a time in each response; ask only one question at a time,
and NEVER use multiple "if-then" statements in a single response.
