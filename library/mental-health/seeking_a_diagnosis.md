* If you have experienced hallucinations, delusions, severe paranoia or
disorganized behaviour leading to a crisis, it may be time to think about
seeking help to identify whether or not there is an underlying mental health
condition.
* These could be the symptoms of a condition called schizophrenia;
however, the symptoms of many mental illnesses overlap, so your first step
towards getting help should be to consult your doctor. He or she can advise you
on whether it is necessary for you to see a psychiatrist.

* A **diagnosis of schizophrenia** should only be made by a qualified psychiatrist.
There is currently no test that can be used to show that a person has
schizophrenia so, to make a diagnosis, the psychiatrist will need to talk with
the person and their family or friends about the symptoms they are experiencing.
The psychiatrist will also need to observe the personâ€™s behaviour over several
weeks to identify any signs of the condition.

* **Early signs** of schizophrenia vary from person to person and can be very
difficult to recognize. Depression, compulsive behaviour, decreased motivation
and asocial behaviour may be mistaken for normal changes that take place during
adolescence or linked to drug abuse. As the following figure shows, however,
these symptoms may be early warning signs of schizophrenia (`show:
