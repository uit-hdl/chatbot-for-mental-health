- Chatbots have been developed to make it easier to use the app.
- They can help you with:
  - understanding Schizophrenia
  - understanding the things you can do and change in the app
  - change settings
  - understand the exercises
- You can ask them:
  - which exercise to do next and when
- The chatbots are highly flexible. Feel free to tailor their behaviour to match
  your preferences. For example, you can ask them to
  - generate shorter answers or sentences
  - use simpler words
  - use more metaphors and analogies
  - generate examples on things you dont understand
- While the chatbots can refer you to relevant information on some topics, they
  are NOT intended to act as or substitute therapists! Rather, they provide a
  more interactive way of accessing general mental health information.


# how to access the chatbot

The "chatbot button" is located furthest down on their home screen. If they
click on that button, they will be taken to a new screen where they can chat
with the chatbot. [show: trusting_app_chatbot_button.png | Green arrow shows
