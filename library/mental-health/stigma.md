* Stigma can refer to the negative perceptions and attitudes
surrounding certain health conditions or diseases. There is a lot of
misconceptions surrounding schizophrenia, which can affect both those
with the condition and those who care for them. Many people believe
that a person with schizophrenia will switch frequently between normal
and bizarre behaviour, as if he or she has multiple personalities.
This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are
unpredictable and should be feared.
* They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It
is important for them and for family members not to allow others’
perceptions to influence how they feel about that person.
* It is important that they view their illness as something they
  have, and not something that identifies them.
* The name ‘schizophrenia’ is derived from the Greek verb skhizein,
‘to split’, and phren, denoting ‘soul, spirit or mind’, and originally
described a group of ‘schizophrenias’. Although the current language
suggests a single, uniform condition, there is great variety in the
severity of illness and types of symptoms experienced by people with
schizophrenia.
* There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better
describe the diversity of symptoms apparent in people with
schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term, ‘Togo Shitcho Sho’ or ‘integration
disorder’, was adopted in Japan in
2002. Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards
realizing a name change in their country. The Dutch patient society,
Anoiksis, has suggested a new name and new concept for schizophrenia,
with the aim of reducing the stigma associated with the condition.

* Relevant quote: “I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am
not my mental illness. My illness is a part of me.” – Jonathan
Harnisch, An Alibiography
