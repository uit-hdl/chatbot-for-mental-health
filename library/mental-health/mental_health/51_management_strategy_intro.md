* “Mental illness is not a choice, but recovery is.” – Unknown

The aims of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent psychotic
episodes and enable the person with schizophrenia to progress along
the road to recovery [show `factors_of_recovery.png`]. A treatment
plan that combines medication with psychotherapy, often referred to as
‘talking therapy’, and peer-to-peer contact is often the most
effective approach, but everyone is different and it is important to
find the right combination of therapies for you.
