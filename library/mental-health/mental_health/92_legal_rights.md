# Legal and financial issues

Advice on your legal rights can be obtained from your healthcare team,
citizenâ€™s rights organizations and support groups. There are two
reasons why it may be a good idea to investigate your rights. First,
if your condition places limitations on your ability to work, you may
be entitled to financial benefits. Secondly, it is a good idea to know
your legal rights if abnormal behaviour during psychotic episodes
leads to dealings with the police and legal system.
