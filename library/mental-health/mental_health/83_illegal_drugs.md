It is common, especially for young people, to turn to drugs such as
cannabis or amphetamines to try and block out the symptoms of
schizophrenia. You may think that illegal drugs will help to numb
feelings of depression or anxiety but, although some drugs may give
temporary relief, in the long term they may actually make symptoms of
schizophrenia worse or cause a relapse.

Some illegal drugs can increase symptoms such as paranoia,
hallucinations and delusions. As the effects of illegal drugs may
worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia, it can be difficult for your
doctors to be sure that the medication you are receiving is working
properly if you are taking other drugs at the same time. More
importantly, mixing drugs can be highly dangerous to your health.
