Schizophrenia is not easy to live with. It can put strain on your
relationships with people in your family or those you share a home
with. During relapses in your illness, you may not realize the demands
that are being made of people around you; when you emerge into
recovery, you may find yourself feeling rather lonely. Likewise, it
can be difficult to live with a person with schizophrenia.
Nevertheless, there are some practical steps you can take together to
make things easier.

If you are planning a family, there are a number of issues that you
need to discuss with your partner early on, such as the risk of your
child developing schizophrenia, how you will manage having a child,
and, if you are a woman, the possibility that you will relapse after
giving birth or during the pregnancy. There will be decisions that are
not easy to make, but information from your healthcare team can aid in
difficult discussions. As mentioned in Chapter 5, some medications
used to treat schizophrenia may not be suitable for use during
pregnancy. Therefore, you should discuss your options with your doctor
before trying to conceive a child.
