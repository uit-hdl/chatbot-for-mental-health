# How will the illness progress?

Once the signs of schizophrenia begin to show, you may notice that
patterns in your condition emerge. Having a different range of
symptoms at different times is to be expected; there are distinct
‘phases’ of schizophrenia, which can occur in cycles.

[show: 32_stages_of_progression.png | illustrates stages below]

## Prodromal (beginning) phase

- You may notice a gradual change in mood and behaviour before any
  obvious and serious changes occur
- You may learn to recognize the early warning signs of a relapse into
  the active phase of the illness

## Acute (active) phase

- This is the point when symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions
  and disordered thinking become impossible to ignore
- You may reach a crisis point during this phase – if this happens,
  the safest place to be may be in hospital

## Residual phase

- Most people find that their condition stabilizes and that severe
  symptoms begin to fade away with treatment
- Some symptoms may remain, but this can vary widely from person to
  person
- You may experience relapses into the prodromal and acute phases, but
  these can be minimized with appropriate medication and support

# Other explanations for schizophrenia-like symptoms

- Substance abuse – Using illegal drugs may cause symptoms of
  psychosis including hallucinations or changes in personality.
- Combining medications – Taking medications that interact with each
  other may lead to hallucinations.
- Bipolar disorder – In some instances, such as during severe manic
  episodes, people with bipolar disorder may experience hallucinations
  and delusions.
- Depression – Changes in mood, personality and energy may be signs of
  depression. In severe cases of depression, known as psychotic
  depression, people may experience delusions.
