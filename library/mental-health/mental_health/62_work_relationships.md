Many people with schizophrenia are able to continue working once their
condition is under control. Others decide to adjust their work
commitments to suit their condition. This can include changing to a
less stressful role, reducing their number of working hours or taking
up a job share.

Some employers are more flexible than others in their attitudes
towards allowing people to change their work contracts; however,
national and international laws are in place to protect against
discrimination in the workplace. If you need to find out more about
your rights, there are a number of sources of help and guidance
available to you, including the human resources department of your
company, citizen’s rights organizations and schizophrenia support
groups.

A personal perspective on working as a person with schizophrenia “I’m
a mechanical engineer by first degree, and I also studied business
administration. I design machine parts for a big company in Israel. I
do have good colleagues at work, and I appreciate them very much. I
consider it a good place to work. My colleagues at work notice when
I’m getting better. They don’t bother me too much, and they don’t ask
difficult questions – they let me continue with my day without
sticking their noses in things that are a bit delicate.” – Ronan
