* “Mental illness is not a choice, but recovery is.” – Unknown The
aims of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent psychotic episodes
and enable the person with schizophrenia to progress along the road to
recovery [show `factors_of_recovery.png`]. A treatment plan that
combines medication with psychotherapy, often referred to as ‘talking
therapy’, and peer-to-peer contact is often the most effective
approach, but everyone is different and it is important to find the
right combination of therapies for you.

# Medication
* “I think that medication keeps me going, and it has played a crucial
role until now. My goal is to reduce my medication little by little. I
try to be quite educated – I read a lot about it and I discuss it with
my doctor.” – Monika

* There are many different medication options for schizophrenia and it
  is important to find the right one for you [show
  `medication_effects_side_effects_and_administration.png`]. The
  medication your psychiatrist recommends will depend on a number of
  things, including how you feel about your treatment, how well the
  medicine controls your symptoms and whether you suffer any
  unacceptable unwanted effects.
* Different medications reduce some symptoms of schizophrenia more
  than others, so you will need to decide which symptoms you most want
  to control. Like many medicines, those used to treat schizophrenia
  can also have side effects. Different medications will have
  different side effects from each other, and the effects of one
  medication may change over time. Your psychiatrist will monitor your
  progress once you have begun treatment, and may suggest options for
  reducing side effects such as adjusting the dose or switching to a
  different medication. Another consideration is that medications can
  be taken in different ways; for example, medicines can be taken
  daily as tablets or liquids, or injected every few weeks.
* With so many options and factors to consider, it is important that
  you discuss what you most want from your treatment with your
  psychiatrist as early on in the process as possible; for example,
  you may have a specific aim for your treatment, or there may be a
  specific symptom or side effect that you want to avoid. Finding a
  psychiatrist with whom you ‘click’ can make talking about your
  condition easier, and this can help to ensure that you make
  decisions about goals for your treatment together.

* “I think that medications have different effects on people with
  mental illness. For me, six or seven kinds of antipsychotics were
  tried over 10 years. Finding the right medication was a turning
  point in my life. My basic antipsychotic was an injection, which was
  given every second week for 5 years, and I took antidepressants too.
  In 2011, I felt that there was no more improvement with this
  medication and, after discussion with my doctor, I changed to pills.
  Since then we have achieved a big improvement in my health. I am
  still taking the pills with an antidepressant. We have reduced the
  amount of medication since 2011. This has to be done little by
  little.” – István
