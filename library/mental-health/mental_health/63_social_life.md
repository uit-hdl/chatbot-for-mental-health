It can be difficult to maintain a social life if you have
schizophrenia. As mentioned earlier in this guide, schizophrenia can
lead to symptoms including being less able to socialize and a lack of
emotion, so you may lose touch with people you were friends with. As
you start to recover, however, you may find yourself wanting to go out
and socialize more.

Support groups can be a good way to meet and socialize with other
people with schizophrenia, but it is important not to surround
yourself completely with others who have the condition. Meeting and
socializing with people without the illness can help you to see a
world outside of schizophrenia. Psychotherapy can help you to regain
your confidence and overcome the social barriers associated with
mental illness, to enable you to have a normal social life. Caring for
someone with schizophrenia can also affect your social life; it is
important to recognize this and to take steps to make sure your own
needs are met. Sharing responsibilities with other family members
and/or caregivers can be a good way to allow you to have some time to
yourself, to socialize and to do other things that you enjoy.
