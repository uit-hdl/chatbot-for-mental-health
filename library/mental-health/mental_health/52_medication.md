“I think that medication keeps me going, and it has played a crucial
role until now. My goal is to reduce my medication little by little. I
try to be quite educated – I read a lot about it and I discuss it with
my doctor.” – Monika

# Deciding on a medication

There are many different medication options for schizophrenia and it is
important to find the right one for you [show
medication_effects_side_effects_and_administration.png]. The medication your
psychiatrist recommends will depend on a number of things, including how you
feel about your treatment, how well the medicine controls your symptoms and
whether you suffer any unacceptable unwanted effects.

Different medications reduce some symptoms of schizophrenia more than
others, so you will need to decide which symptoms you most want to
control. Like many medicines, those used to treat schizophrenia can
also have side effects. Different medications will have different side
effects from each other, and the effects of one medication may change
over time. Your psychiatrist will monitor your progress once you have
begun treatment, and may suggest options for reducing side effects
such as adjusting the dose or switching to a different medication.
Another consideration is that medications can be taken in different
ways; for example, medicines can be taken daily as tablets or liquids,
or injected every few weeks.

With so many options and factors to consider, it is important that you
discuss what you most want from your treatment with your psychiatrist
as early on in the process as possible; for example, you may have a
specific aim for your treatment, or there may be a specific symptom or
side effect that you want to avoid. Finding a psychiatrist with whom
you ‘click’ can make talking about your condition easier, and this can
help to ensure that you make decisions about goals for your treatment
together.

“I think that medications have different effects on people with mental
illness. For me, six or seven kinds of antipsychotics were tried over
10 years. Finding the right medication was a turning point in my life.
My basic antipsychotic was an injection, which was given every second
week for 5 years, and I took antidepressants too. In 2011, I felt that
there was no more improvement with this medication and, after
discussion with my doctor, I changed to pills. Since then we have
achieved a big improvement in my health. I am still taking the pills
with an antidepressant. We have reduced the amount of medication since
2011. This has to be done little by little.” – István

# Sticking to medication

Once you start receiving medication, it can be tempting to think that
your lack of symptoms means that you don’t need the medication any
more. If you start skipping doses, however, it is likely that your
symptoms will return; up to 80% of people who stop taking their
medication relapse within 1 year.4 In some instances, suddenly
stopping your medication can be harmful. Therefore you should always
talk with your psychiatrist before making any decisions about your
treatment. Above all, if you decide to stop taking your medication, it
is important that you tell someone.

# Coming of medication

[QUERY FOR RELEVANCE] There may be some special situations when it
might be necessary to stop taking your medication; for example, during
pregnancy or while breastfeeding. In these cases, the benefits to you
of the medication will be assessed against its risks to the baby. You
may be advised to discontinue your medication long enough before you
become pregnant for the medicine to be cleared from your system;
however, this will depend entirely on your individual situation, so it
is crucial that you discuss with your psychiatrist any plans you have
for starting or expanding your family.

“Medication is important because it protects me from having a
psychotic episode. I take my pills every night if I don’t take them I
know that there’s a possibility of a psychotic episode.” – Ronan
