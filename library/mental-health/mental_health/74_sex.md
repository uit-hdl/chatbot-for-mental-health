Healthy sexual relationships are important and you should not ignore
this part of your life. Schizophrenia itself and some medications for
schizophrenia can lead to reduced sexual desire. On the other hand,
you may experience unusual or strong sexual feelings. Increased sexual
behaviour and strange thoughts of a sexual nature are likely to be
related to the changes in the mind that occur as part of the
condition. As schizophrenia usually first becomes apparent during a
personâ€™s late teens and early twenties, when libido is typically high,
it is not surprising that changes in sexual thoughts often occur at
this time. If you have a tendency to take part in high-risk sexual
behaviour, your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, such
as HIV, is high. Therefore, it is important to understand the risks
and to seek advice for maintaining good sexual health from your
doctor.
