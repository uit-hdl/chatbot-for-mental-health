Many people with schizophrenia struggle with their physical health as
well as their mental health. They have a high risk of heart disease
and obesity, which means that people with schizophrenia have a shorter
life expectancy than the general population One reason for this could
be that the symptoms of schizophrenia make it difficult to maintain a
healthy lifestyle; some unhealthy behaviours, such as eating unhealthy
foods, drinking alcohol, taking illegal drugs and smoking, are common
in people with schizophrenia.

Furthermore, some of the medications used to treat people with
schizophrenia can have a negative effect on general health; for
example, weight gain is a common side effect of many medicines for the
condition. Whether or not you choose to adjust your lifestyle is up to
you, but there are several ways in which looking after your general
health can help in the overall management of your condition.
