Schizophrenia can change the way that you care for yourself: poor personal
hygiene is common among people with the condition. This aspect of the illness
may arise from symptoms such as a lack of motivation or delusions. Dental
problems in particular can develop due to dry mouth caused by medication, or if
you forget to take care of your teeth. Therefore, it is important to tell your
dentist what medication you are taking and to follow their advice on oral
health. Making a checklist of daily tasks, such as brushing your teeth,
showering and getting dressed, can help you to avoid self-neglect. Doing these
tasks at the same time each day can help to establish a daily routine.
