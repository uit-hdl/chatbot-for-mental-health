Schizophrenia affects the way you think, feel and act. Each person
with schizophrenia will have different combinations of symptoms,
making one individual’s experience very different from another’s. It
can be difficult to link the way you are feeling to the way in which
doctors describe the symptoms of schizophrenia. Medical professionals
often divide the symptoms of schizophrenia into three categories:
positive, negative and cognitive. The following pages explain what
these categories mean and give some examples.

# Positive symptoms

This term is used to describe feelings or experiences that do not
correspond to reality, such as hallucinations, delusions or paranoid
thoughts.

- Hallucinations – This means hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting or
  smelling something that is not really there. – Hearing voices is a
  common hallucination; some people may find the voices non-threatening
  or even comforting, while others may find them disturbing and
  frightening.
- Delusions – Delusions or deluded thinking means strongly believing
  in something that cannot be true. – This can be things like thinking
  that you are being watched, believing that you are a famous person,
  or believing that the television or radio is sending you signals.
- Paranoid thoughts – Paranoia is extreme distrust, or believing the
  worst. – Examples include feeling that other people are plotting
  against you or are trying to harm you.

# Negative symptoms

This term describes a lack of feelings or behaviours that are usually
present. Negative symptoms can include low motivation or mood, or
withdrawing from family and friends.

- Low motivation – This can be losing interest in any or all aspects
  of life. – A lack of energy can mean that you find it difficult to do
  simple things, such as getting out of bed.
- Lack of emotion – This lack of feeling can be shown by a lack of
  expression, a flat tone of voice or a lack of eye contact. • Social
  withdrawal – This is not wanting to socialize with family or friends,
  preferring to spend most of your time alone.

# Cognitive symptoms

This term is used to refer to changes in mental capacity, such as
difficulties concentrating or remembering things.

- Disorganized thoughts and speech – Fragmented thinking can come
  across in the way you speak and is characteristic of schizophrenia. –
  Examples include responding to questions with an unrelated answer,
  and saying illogical things.
- Lack of concentration or attention – A lack of concentration or
  attention can mean that tasks like reading a book or watching a
  television programme become very difficult and frustrating. – Thought
  processes can be slowed, which can make interacting with others
  difficult.
- Memory problems – Remembering events or information, or learning
  new things, may become challenging.

# A personal perspective on the symptoms of schizophrenia

- “I have felt for a long time, from the beginning of this, that I am
  in a different dimension. My feelings and thoughts are not natural.
  They are a stranger’s, they are not mine. I have felt that I am
  special; that I have discovered the truth, the authority in the
  background. I have felt that I am a messenger between the universe
  and the earth. I am in a special position; I am the chosen one. I
  have felt that everybody wants to hide something from me. They don’t
  want me to know the truth. I have felt that everybody is playing a
  role. And everybody is talking about me, and they can hear my
  thoughts. For a long time I was afraid to go out in the streets. I
  didn’t have control of reality. My thinking was not normal. I was
  watching the ‘signs’ that ‘they’ were trying to send and show me. I
  made connections between my feelings and thoughts and the outside
  world. It was scary. I could express these things only after the bad
  period: in that state, I could not. It was a changed state of mind.
  I had no private life. I thought that the people wanted to
  communicate with me about something without speaking.” – István
