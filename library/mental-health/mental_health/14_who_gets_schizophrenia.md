Schizophrenia is a common mental illness, affecting about 1 in every
100 people. Anyone can develop schizophrenia. It is seen in people of
all cultures across the world, and affects equal numbers of men and
women. It can also affect people of almost any age, although the
symptoms of schizophrenia usually first appear when a person is in
their late teens or early twenties.

There have been a number of notable people with schizophrenia: John
Nash, the mathematician and Nobel Prize winner; Lionel Aldridge, the
Super Bowl-winning National Football League player; Vincent van
Gogh, the artist; and Tom Harrell, the jazz musician. These examples
show that people with schizophrenia can achieve great things.
