One way of making sure that the decisions made in your life are your own, even
during times of crisis, is to have a plan of how you would like to be treated if
you do lose control of your behaviour. You can record any wishes you might have
in an ‘advance directive’ [show: 91_advance_directive_card.png]. [Notify user
that future versions of this chatbot might have a dedicated chatbot agent for
helping to create an advance directive card]

The advance directive may include the name and contact details of a family
member or caregiver who is to be given authority to act as an advocate on your
behalf, as well as information relating to your preferences on medication,
finance and housing.
