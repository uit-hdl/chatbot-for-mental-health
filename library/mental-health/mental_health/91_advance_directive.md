# Advance directive

One way of making sure that the decisions made in your life are your
own, even during times of crisis, is to have a plan of how you would
like to be treated if you do lose control of your behaviour. You can
record any wishes you might have in an ‘advance directive’ [show
`91_advance_directive_card.png`]. [Notify user that future versions of
this chatbot will have a separate chatbot agent for creating an
advance directive card]

The advance directive may include the name and contact details of a
family member or caregiver who is to be given authority to act as an
advocate on your behalf, as well as information relating to your
preferences on medication, finance and housing.
