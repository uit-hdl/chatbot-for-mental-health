* If you are affected by schizophrenia, you may wonder at some point
whether it is your fault. The answer to that question is no. No one is
to blame for schizophrenia. The reasons why some people develop the
condition and some do not are currently unknown, although there are
some factors that are thought to increase a person’s susceptibility to
the condition.

# Genes and environment
* Schizophrenia is sometimes referred to as a heritable condition,
which means that if there are certain genes in a person’s DNA their
risk of developing the illness is increased compared with people
without those genes. The chance that a person will develop
schizophrenia is increased from about 1 in 100 to about 1 in 10 if one
of their parents has the condition.
* In identical twins with exactly the same genetic make-up, however,
the chance of one twin developing schizophrenia if the other twin has
the condition is only 50%, and so we know that genetics are not the
sole cause of the condition.
* Likewise, there is no single `environmental factor` that is known to
cause schizophrenia, although there are certain factors that can
increase a person’s chances of having the illness: these include
growing up in a city center, abusing drugs such as cannabis and
amphetamines, and experiencing stressful life events. There is some
evidence that the environment a person is exposed to can interact with
their genes. Research into this phenomenon is ongoing, but not enough
is currently known to say who will or won’t develop schizophrenia.

* A key feature of schizophrenia is that different combinations of
   symptoms are seen both between individuals and within an individual
   over time – whether this has anything to do with an individual’s
   genes and/or environment is still unclear.
