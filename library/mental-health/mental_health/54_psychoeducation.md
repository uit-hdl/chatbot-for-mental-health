Psychoeducation is based on the idea that the more you and your family and
caregivers know about your condition, the better you will be able to manage it
together. It involves a trained therapist delivering a clearly defined programme
that has been designed to educate participants about mental illness. A course of
psychoeducation may include a series of sessions over months or years, and can
be aimed specifically at caregivers and family members, at people with
schizophrenia, or a combination of both.

Because the therapy involves taking in a lot of information, going to sessions
when your condition is most stable is likely to be most effective. Many people
find that they benefit not only from the information they receive during
psychoeducation but also from the learning process itself. Psychoeducation
should be used in combination with psychotherapy and medication, and can help
you develop coping strategies that use your own knowledge of your illness.
Furthermore, it can be a great help to family members and caregivers, as a
better understanding of the condition can help them to recognize and meet the
needs of the person with schizophrenia.
