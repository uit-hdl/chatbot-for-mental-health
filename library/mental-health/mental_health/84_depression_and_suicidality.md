# Depression and suicidality

About one in three people with schizophrenia will experience low mood
or depression at some point. Tragically, suicide rates are higher in
people with schizophrenia than in the general population. Therefore,
it is of the utmost importance that you recognize the warning signs of
suicidality and learn ways in which to combat negative thoughts.

# Signs of suicidality

- Feeling like a burden to family and friends Feeling hopeless or
  helpless, as if there is no solution to the problem at hand
- Talking about wanting to die
- Reckless or dangerous behaviour
- No longer fearing death
- Drinking excessively or abusing drugs
- Asocial behaviour
- Writing a suicide note

Although at the time it may seem like you will feel this way forever,
there are several things that you can do to beat depression, and it is
crucial that you talk to someone about your feelings.

ways to improve your mood

- Talk to your psychiatrist: you may be suffering from a depressive
  illness that is treatable.
- Get some rest: a good night’s sleep can make you feel a lot better
  and your outlook may be different in the morning.
- Get a change of scenery: you may associate one particular place with
  being depressed, so leaving this place can reduce these feelings.
- Visit friends or family: isolation and boredom can worsen negative
  feelings, so socializing with others is a good way to prevent this.
- Do something you enjoy: don’t forget that there are things that make
  you happy.
- Learn to relax: ask your doctor or therapist about relaxation
  therapies, such as meditation.
- Talk to someone: sharing your problems with others, whoever they may
  be, can be a weight off your mind.
- Phone a helpline: helplines can be useful when you need to talk but
  feel you have no one to talk to. If you feel you are close to a
  crisis, it is of the utmost importance that you tell someone –
  people who work for helplines can give you the practical advice and
  support you need.
