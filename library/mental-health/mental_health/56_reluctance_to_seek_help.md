There may be times when a family member or friend thinks that you should seek
medical help, but you believe that you are well and feel reluctant to do so.
Talking to someone who has been in a similar position may be useful, as they may
help to ease your fears.

As a family member or friend, it can be extremely difficult to broach this
subject, and the way that you react can be important in determining the outcome
for the person with schizophrenia. First, it is a good idea to discuss the
situation together as early as possible, or at a time when the person with
schizophrenia feels well; the more time that passes, the more likely it is that
a crisis point will be reached. A support group for family members and
caregivers may be able to provide valuable advice.

Secondly, try speaking to someone who can give you the perspective of a person
with schizophrenia. If possible, try to arrange for a doctor to visit the person
with schizophrenia at home. This may be particularly useful as it can allow all
members of the household to be involved.

If, as a person with schizophrenia, you do not accept help, it is important for
you to know that there is a legal process that can lead to your compulsory
admission to hospital and treatment if there is a risk of harm to you or others.
This would be a very distressing course of action for all involved and so family
members and caregivers should see this option as a last resort. Further
information on compulsory hospital admission and treatment will be available
from your local support group, citizenâ€™s rights organization or the healthcare
service in your country.
