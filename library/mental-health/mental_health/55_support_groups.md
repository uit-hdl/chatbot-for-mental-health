Living with schizophrenia can be isolating at times. Joining a support
group can be a good way to socialize and share experiences with others
who know what it is like to live with the condition. Many support
groups have been set up by people with schizophrenia, and include
people who are successfully managing their condition and moving on
with their lives.

Different groups specialize in different types of support, and can
operate at local, national and international levels. One benefit of
joining a support group is that it can be much easier to talk about
your problems and feelings with people who know what you are going
through than with, for example, a family member or therapist. People
with schizophrenia are experts in their own condition, and so they may
be able to give helpful advice based on their experiences. Sharing
stories and finding common ground can also create a bond of
friendship.

[NOT FOR USER] Further information about support groups is given in
Chapter 9 of this booklet.
