- There’s a lot of evidence that meditation can help with schizophrenia. Meditation itself appears to change brain structure, and some of these changes may help people with mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Some of the best research is with mindfulness meditation. This is a form of meditation where you focus on being aware of what you sense and how you feel in the moment, without any judgment. Early research suggests that it can:

- Improve anger and aggression if you’re going through an active phase of schizophrenia, where you may have symptoms such as hallucinations
- Decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety if your schizophrenia has stabilized
- Enhance your awareness of your disease
Shorten lengths of inpatient stays and reduce re-hospitalization rates

- One study found that 8 months of mindfulness meditation led to significant reductions in persistent hallucination and delusion symptoms of patients who have had severe schizophrenia for more than 2 decades.

- An easy way to start is to try a loving-kindness meditation. These focus on developing feelings of goodwill, kindness, and warmth toward others. One study published in the Journal of Schizophrenia Research found that loving-kindness meditation was associated with decreased negative symptoms and increased positive emotions among people with schizophrenia.

- Progressive muscle relaxation is a type of relaxation exercise that helps to reduce stress and anxiety in your body by having you slowly tense, then relax, each muscle. The goal is to teach you self-awareness as to when you feel tension and give you tools to help relax.

- A 2019 review of five studies of over 200 adults with schizophrenia found that Progressive muscle relaxation did help relieve anxiety and improve well-being and social functioning.
