* If you have noticed the signs of schizophrenia in yourself or
received a diagnosis, one of the first questions you will have is
“What is schizophrenia?” Schizophrenia is a long-term condition that
results from changes in the mind and causes a range of different
psychological symptoms.
* People with schizophrenia do not choose their illness, any more than
people with a physical illness do. Importantly, there is no known
cause – no one is responsible for a person developing schizophrenia
and no one is to blame.
* Schizophrenia is a treatable mental illness and many people with the
condition lead completely normal lives; however, it is often
sensationalized in the media, which has led to a range of
misconceptions about the nature of the illness.
