* Once you start receiving medication, it can be tempting to think
that your lack of symptoms means that you don’t need the medication
any more. If you start skipping doses, however, it is likely that your
symptoms will return; up to 80% of people who stop taking their
medication relapse within 1 year. In some instances, suddenly stopping
your medication can be harmful. Therefore you should always talk with
your psychiatrist before making any decisions about your treatment.
Above all, if you decide to stop taking your medication, it is
important that you tell someone.

* “Medication is important because it protects me from having a
psychotic episode. I take my pills every night if I don’t take them I
know that there’s a possibility of a psychotic episode.” – Ronan
