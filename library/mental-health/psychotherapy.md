There are many different types of psychotherapy but the common goals
that they all share include:
* solving problems that you are currently having
* teaching you skills to overcome problems in the future 
* helping you to become self-sufficient.

* Psychotherapy usually involves sitting down with a therapist, either
one to one or in a group, and engaging in open dialogue about your
condition.

* Discussions of how to cope with your illness may include how to
manage your mood and how to respond positively to whatever triggers
your symptoms. A psychotherapist may sometimes encourage you to
explore difficult and painful emotions and experiences, such as
feelings of anxiety and depression, or specific traumatic events. For
this and other reasons, it is important to find a therapist who you
feel at ease with, to maximize the potential benefits. Indeed, if you
and your therapist trust and respect each other, the treatment is more
likely to work.

* The specific goal of **cognitive behavioural therapy** is to change
unhealthy patterns you may have developed in your thinking or
behaviour. A structured approach of identifying goals and setting
small tasks for you to practise between sessions is used to address
specific problems. This approach is also used to teach you the
techniques to manage problems that may arise in the future.

* **Family-focused therapy** recognizes that schizophrenia can affect
whole families, not just the person with the condition. The specific
aims of family-focused therapy are to aid communication between family
members and to build a supportive environment for the person with
schizophrenia.

* There are many **other types of psychotherapy**; for example,
hypnotherapy, psychoanalysis, and expressive therapies such as art and
music therapy. Some of these are likely to be more useful to you than
others and, importantly, some may interfere with the management
strategy you and your healthcare team have agreed on. Therefore, you
should talk to your psychiatrists and psychotherapists about any new
approach you may want to try.
