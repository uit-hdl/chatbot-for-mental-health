* Would be cool if the bot was able to create summaries of the style of
  communication that a person prefers. This bot would look at previous
  conversations, and try to infer things like:

1. Does the person like long answers or short answers? Do they prefer that the
   bot often asks for confirmation that they understand, or do they show signs
   that they find this irritating?
2. Does the person like bots that are polite and generate responses with a lot
   of fluff, or does he prefer more direct answers?
3. What concepts did the person struggle to understand in the past? Do they tend
   to struggle more with technical information? What about science, do they
   respond well to scientific information? Are they encouraged by scientific
   information, or do they find it uninteresting? Does simplifying language and
   avoiding jargon seem to help them understand better?
4. Technical details relating to their login to the online diary: Did they use
   1-password for logging in? Did they use 1password for storing their password?
   Are they using mobile phone or laptop? Which web-browser did they use?
