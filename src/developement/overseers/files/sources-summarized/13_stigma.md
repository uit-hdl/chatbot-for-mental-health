Stigma and misconceptions surrounding schizophrenia can lead to fear and self-stigmatization. It's important for individuals with schizophrenia and their families not to let others' perceptions influence their feelings about the condition. The term schizophrenia means "split mind" but it actually describes a variety of symptoms and severity. Alternative names, such as "Togo Shitcho Sho" or "integration disorder," have been suggested to reduce stigma. It's helpful for individuals to think of their illness as something they have, not something that identifies them. The manual also discusses confiding in others about schizophrenia and how to talk to them about it.
