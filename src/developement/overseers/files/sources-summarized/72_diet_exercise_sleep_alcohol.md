The treatment for schizophrenia can cause weight gain, so a healthy diet is important to minimize this risk. Alcohol should also be avoided due to the increased likelihood of alcoholism in those with schizophrenia. Regular exercise can help control weight and improve mood, and maintaining a consistent sleep routine is important for managing symptoms and avoiding fatigue. Avoiding caffeine and incorporating relaxation techniques can also help with sleep.
