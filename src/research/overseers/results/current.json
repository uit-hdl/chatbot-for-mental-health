Sticking to a healthy diet is a good way to minimize this risk. Your\ndoctor will monitor your weight and, if weight gain becomes a problem, it may be\nworth discussing different medication options.\n\n# Alcohol\n\nDrinking to excess should be avoided, not only to improve your general health\nbut also because there is a strong association between schizophrenia and\nalcoholism, which means that the risk of becoming addicted to alcohol is greater\nif you have schizophrenia. Therefore, it is a good idea to moderate your\ndrinking as much as\u00a0possible.\n\n# Physical exercise\n\nThere are several reasons to incorporate a physical exercise regimen into your\nlifestyle. First, getting a good amount of exercise will help you to control\nyour weight in combination with a healthy diet. Secondly, exercise can put you\nin a better frame of mind, as hormones released during exercise are associated\nwith improved mood. Exercise can also improve the way you sleep.\n\n# Sleep\n\nPeople with schizophrenia tend to have disrupted sleep patterns: you may find\nyourself sleeping more or less than most people, or at different times of the\nday. This can lead to excessive tiredness, known as fatigue. A change in sleep\npatterns can be the first sign of a psychotic episode, and therefore can be\ntaken as a warning sign. Maintaining a regular routine can help you to get your\nsleep patterns back to normal. This can include having a bedtime routine, going\nto bed at the same time and waking up at the same time. Relaxation techniques,\nsuch as meditation, can help to reduce stress; this is important because stress\ncan stop you sleeping peacefully. Caffeine should be avoided, especially in the\nevening, as it can disrupt your sleep.\n[`sleep_assistant` provides in-depth info on sleep if user is interested]\n"
