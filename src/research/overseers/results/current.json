Let's simplify it: when\ndoctors and researchers look at many people with schizophrenia, they notice that\nsome people get completely better, some people get better but still have some\nsymptoms sometimes, and some people still have symptoms that bother them a lot.\nThey found that for every 5 people with schizophrenia:\n\n- 1 person gets completely better in 5 years.\n- 3 people get better, but might still have symptoms from time to time.\n- 1 person might continue to have symptoms that are more difficult to manage.\n\nThis is just a general observation and does not tell us exactly what will happen\nto any one person, like you. Everyone is different, and your own chances of\ngetting better depend on your situation, your body, and the treatment you get.\nIt means there is hope and a possibility of improvement.

The answer to this question may give\nyou an idea of who you should tell about having schizophrenia. It is\noften a good idea to explain your condition to the people with whom\nyou have the closest relationships; for example, those you live with\nand those you work closely with. It may not be necessary to tell\npeople who you do not have strong bonds with. Ultimately, everyone\u2019s\nsituation is different, and only you will know what is best for your\nown situation.\n\n# Will I get better?\n\n[show: statistics_on_who_gets_better.png] 1 in 5 people will recover\ncompletely within 5 years. 3 in 5 people will improve, but may still\nexperience symptoms occasionally. 1 in 5 people will continue to have\ntroublesome symptoms.\n\nThere is a common misconception that people with schizophrenia have no\nchance of recovery. This is not true: the symptoms of schizophrenia\ncan improve with appropriate treatment, and some people recover\ncompletely. Recovery is a process that involves learning to manage\nyour symptoms, developing support systems and working towards your\ngoals. Appropriate ways to manage your condition with medication and\ntherapy are outlined in the next part of this guide.\n"
