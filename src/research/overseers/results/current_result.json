Start Small: Begin with a simple greeting or a comment about the\nimmediate environment or situation, such as the weather or an event\nyou're both attending.\n\n2. Use Open-Ended Questions: Ask questions that invite more than a yes\nor no response. For example, \"What brings you to this event?\" or \"What\ndo you like about this activity?\"\n\n3. Look for Common Ground: Notice if the other person is wearing\nsomething or carrying an item that suggests a shared interest, like a\nbook or a sports team logo, and use that as a conversation starter.\n\n4. Offer a Compliment: Giving a genuine compliment can break the ice and\nstart a conversation on a positive note.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Body Language: Smile and make appropriate eye contact\nto appear friendly and approachable.\n\n6. Listen Actively: Show that you're interested in what the other person\nis saying by nodding and responding thoughtfully to their comments.\n\nRemember that it's okay to feel a little nervous and that practice often\nleads to increased comfort over time. Would you like more detailed\nstrategies or assistance in a particular social setting?\n",

The answer to this question may give\nyou an idea of who you should tell about having schizophrenia. It is\noften a good idea to explain your condition to the people with whom\nyou have the closest relationships; for example, those you live with\nand those you work closely with. It may not be necessary to tell\npeople who you do not have strong bonds with. Ultimately, everyone\u2019s\nsituation is different, and only you will know what is best for your\nown situation.\n\n# Will I get better?\n\n[show: statistics_on_who_gets_better.png] 1 in 5 people will recover\ncompletely within 5 years. 3 in 5 people will improve, but may still\nexperience symptoms occasionally. 1 in 5 people will continue to have\ntroublesome symptoms.\n\nThere is a common misconception that people with schizophrenia have no\nchance of recovery. This is not true: the symptoms of schizophrenia\ncan improve with appropriate treatment, and some people recover\ncompletely. Recovery is a process that involves learning to manage\nyour symptoms, developing support systems and working towards your\ngoals. Appropriate ways to manage your condition with medication and\ntherapy are outlined in the next part of this guide.\n"
