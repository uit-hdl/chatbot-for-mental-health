Offer clear and simple facts, such as: \"Schizophrenia is actually a mental\nhealth condition that primarily affects a person's thinking, feeling, and\nbehavior, not their identity.\"\n4. Suggest reliable sources or materials where they can get more accurate\ninformation about schizophrenia if they are interested.\n\nRemember, the goal is to inform and educate, not to argue.

Wild gestures can be distracting.\n\n4. **Posture**: Stand or sit up straight but relaxed. This conveys confidence\nand openness.\n\n5. **Proximity**: Respect personal space and avoid standing too close to the\nother person, which can make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n6. **Mirroring**: Subtly mirroring the other person's body language can create a\nsense of rapport.

Look for Common Ground: Notice if the other person is wearing something or\ncarrying an item that suggests a shared interest, like a book or a sports team\nlogo, and use that as a conversation starter.\n\n4. Offer a Compliment: Giving a genuine compliment can break the ice and start a\nconversation on a positive note.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Body Language: Smile and make appropriate eye contact to appear\nfriendly and approachable.\n\n6. Listen Actively: Show that you're interested in what the other person is\nsaying by nodding and responding thoughtfully to their comments.\n\nRemember that it's okay to feel a little nervous and that practice often leads\nto increased comfort over time.

Secondly, exercise can put you\nin a better frame of mind, as hormones released during exercise are associated\nwith improved mood. Exercise can also improve the way you sleep. People with schizophrenia tend to have disrupted sleep patterns: you may find yourself sleeping more or less than most people, or at different times of the day. This can lead to excessive tiredness, known as fatigue. A change in sleep patterns can be the first sign of a psychotic episode, and therefore can be taken as a warning sign. Maintaining a regular routine can help you to get your sleep patterns back to normal. This can include having a bedtime routine, going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time. Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, can help to reduce stress; this is important because stress can stop you sleeping peacefully.

There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding\nschizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care\nfor them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch\nfrequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple\npersonalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are\nunpredictable and should be feared.\n\nThey may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important\nfor them and for family members not to allow others\u2019 perceptions to influence\nhow they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as\nsomething they have, and not something that identifies them.\n\n**'I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My\nillness is a part of me.'** \u2013 Jonathan Harnisch, An Alibiography\n\nThe name \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, \u2018to split\u2019,\nand phren, denoting \u2018soul, spirit or mind\u2019, and originally described a group of\n\u2018schizophrenias\u2019. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform\ncondition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of\nsymptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.\n\nThere have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the\ndiversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,\n\u2018Togo Shitcho Sho\u2019 or \u2018integration disorder\u2019, was adopted in Japan in 2002.\nPatient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name\nchange in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a\nnew name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma\nassociated with the condition.\n"

Your facial\nexpressions should match the tone of the conversation.\n\n3. **Gestures**: Use hand movements to emphasize what you're saying but try to\nkeep them controlled. Wild gestures can be distracting.\n\n4. **Posture**: Stand or sit up straight but relaxed. This conveys confidence\nand openness.\n\n5. **Proximity**: Respect personal space and avoid standing too close to the\nother person, which can make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n6. **Mirroring**: Subtly mirroring the other person's body language can create a\nsense of rapport.

Look for Common Ground: Notice if the other person is wearing something or\ncarrying an item that suggests a shared interest, like a book or a sports team\nlogo, and use that as a conversation starter.\n\n4. Offer a Compliment: Giving a genuine compliment can break the ice and start a\nconversation on a positive note.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Body Language: Smile and make appropriate eye contact to appear\nfriendly and approachable.\n\n6. Listen Actively: Show that you're interested in what the other person is\nsaying by nodding and responding thoughtfully to their comments.\n\nRemember that it's okay to feel a little nervous and that practice often leads\nto increased comfort over time.
