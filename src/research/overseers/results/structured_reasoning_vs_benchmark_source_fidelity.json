There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding\nschizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care\nfor them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch\nfrequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple\npersonalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are\nunpredictable and should be feared.\n\nThey may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important\nfor them and for family members not to allow others\u2019 perceptions to influence\nhow they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as\nsomething they have, and not something that identifies them.\n\n**'I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My\nillness is a part of me.'** \u2013 Jonathan Harnisch, An Alibiography\n\nThe name \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, \u2018to split\u2019,\nand phren, denoting \u2018soul, spirit or mind\u2019, and originally described a group of\n\u2018schizophrenias\u2019. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform\ncondition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of\nsymptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.\n\nThere have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the\ndiversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,\n\u2018Togo Shitcho Sho\u2019 or \u2018integration disorder\u2019, was adopted in Japan in 2002.\nPatient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name\nchange in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a\nnew name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma\nassociated with the condition.\n"

Offer clear and simple facts, such as: \"Schizophrenia is actually a mental\nhealth condition that primarily affects a person's thinking, feeling, and\nbehavior, not their identity.\"\n4.

Your facial\nexpressions should match the tone of the conversation.\n\n3. **Gestures**: Use hand movements to emphasize what you're saying but try to\nkeep them controlled. Wild gestures can be distracting.\n\n4. **Posture**: Stand or sit up straight but relaxed. This conveys confidence\nand openness.\n\n5. **Proximity**: Respect personal space and avoid standing too close to the\nother person, which can make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n6. **Mirroring**: Subtly mirroring the other person's body language can create a\nsense of rapport.

There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding\nschizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care\nfor them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch\nfrequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple\npersonalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are\nunpredictable and should be feared.\n\nThey may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important\nfor them and for family members not to allow others\u2019 perceptions to influence\nhow they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as\nsomething they have, and not something that identifies them.\n\n**'I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My\nillness is a part of me.'** \u2013 Jonathan Harnisch, An Alibiography\n\nThe name \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, \u2018to split\u2019,\nand phren, denoting \u2018soul, spirit or mind\u2019, and originally described a group of\n\u2018schizophrenias\u2019. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform\ncondition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of\nsymptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.\n\nThere have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the\ndiversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,\n\u2018Togo Shitcho Sho\u2019 or \u2018integration disorder\u2019, was adopted in Japan in 2002.\nPatient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name\nchange in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a\nnew name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma\nassociated with the condition.\n"

Wild gestures can be distracting.\n\n4. **Posture**: Stand or sit up straight but relaxed. This conveys confidence\nand openness.\n\n5. **Proximity**: Respect personal space and avoid standing too close to the\nother person, which can make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n6. **Mirroring**: Subtly mirroring the other person's body language can create a\nsense of rapport.
