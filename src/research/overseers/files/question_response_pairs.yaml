    Stigma surrounding schizophrenia often arises from misconceptions and
    negative perceptions of the condition. Many people believe that individuals
    with schizophrenia often exhibit strange behavior or are unpredictable,
    leading to fear and avoidance.

    It is important to recognize that these misconceptions stem from a lack of
    understanding about the illness. In reality, schizophrenia is a diverse
    condition with varying symptoms and severity. People with schizophrenia are
    unique individuals and should not be defined solely by their illness.

    The term "schizophrenia" itself is derived from Greek and, despite implying
    a "split mind," does not mean that a person has multiple personalities. By
    educating oneself and raising awareness about schizophrenia, we can
    challenge the stigma and alter perceptions of the condition.

    It is essential to remember that others' opinions should not shape one's
    self- perception. You are not defined by your illness; it is only a part of
    who you are. If connecting with others is challenging, there are
    communication strategies and supportive environments available to discuss
    these difficulties.
