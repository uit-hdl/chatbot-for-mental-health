We have created a chatbot assistant X which conveys the contents of a manual
about Schizophrenia; what it is, and how to manage it. We want X to only say
things that are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is
allowed), i.e. convey the materials without adding unsupported statements.
Basically, X should act as an interface between the sources and the user. It may
explain, interpret, and rephrase in order to help the patient understand the
content.

Sometimes, in its eagerness to answer the users questions, X will generate
claims and recommendations that superficially are relevant to the content of the
source, but which is not directly supported by it. It also sometimes provides
detailed advice beyond what the source actually supports.

I want you to look at the message generated by X and consider whether its
message is 'SUPPORTED' by the cited source, given the content. To find out
whether or not a source is SUPPORTED, the following categories are defined:

-   EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: This is a message that is simply saying things that
    are stated directly in the source (perhaps with different words), and no
    logical inferrences or leaps are made. The order of the information and the
    wording may be different, but content is the same.

Now we are ready to define SUPPORTED:

To be suppored, a message needs to satisfy EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED.

# Response format 

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "Summarize briefly (<20 words) the relevant part of the
source"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "Summariz briefly the chatbots assertions"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "Reasoning, followed by SUPPORTED/NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

source: """... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an
impending psychotic episode ..."""

chatbot-message: """If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that disrupted sleep can indicate
that a psychotic episode may happen in the near future"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that sleeping worse than usual could
indicate that user may have a psychotic episde"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The chatbot is applying the rule stated in the source
directly to an individual, so it is SUPPORTED"

## Example 2

source: """... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep ..."""

chatbot-message: """Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
potentiall increase the quality of your sleep, since a more regular routine can
improve sleep-quality."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that a more regular sleep schedule
can improve sleep"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that eating ones evening meal at the
same time every evening can improve sleep"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source states that a more regular schedule may
improve sleep. Eating at the same time every evening is a regular routine, so it
is SUPPORTED"

## Example 3

source: """... It is important for them and for family members not to allow
others’ perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ..."""

chatbot-message: """To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them"""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "With regards to misconceptions, the sources main point
seems to be emphasising the importance of not allowing negative perceptions to
be internalized, and is about internal management of emotions and thoughts"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot encourages challenging false perceptions and
eduating others"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source does not explicitly encourage the patient to
challenge or educate other people, so it is NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Actual content to evaluate

source: """# Who should I tell?

Who you decide to tell about your illness is completely up to you.
Perhaps a useful comparison is to the situation of having a physical
illness – if you had a physical illness that significantly affected
your life, who would you tell? The answer to this question may give
you an idea of who you should tell about having schizophrenia. It is
often a good idea to explain your condition to the people with whom
you have the closest relationships; for example, those you live with
and those you work closely with. It may not be necessary to tell
people who you do not have strong bonds with. Ultimately, everyone’s
situation is different, and only you will know what is best for your
own situation.

# Will I get better?

[show: statistics_on_who_gets_better.png] 1 in 5 people will recover
completely within 5 years. 3 in 5 people will improve, but may still
experience symptoms occasionally. 1 in 5 people will continue to have
troublesome symptoms.

There is a common misconception that people with schizophrenia have no
chance of recovery. This is not true: the symptoms of schizophrenia
can improve with appropriate treatment, and some people recover
completely. Recovery is a process that involves learning to manage
your symptoms, developing support systems and working towards your
goals. Appropriate ways to manage your condition with medication and
therapy are outlined in the next part of this guide.
"""

chatbot-message: """I apologize for any confusion. Let's simplify it: when
doctors and researchers look at many people with schizophrenia, they notice that
some people get completely better, some people get better but still have some
symptoms sometimes, and some people still have symptoms that bother them a lot.
They found that for every 5 people with schizophrenia:

- 1 person gets completely better in 5 years.
- 3 people get better, but might still have symptoms from time to time.
- 1 person might continue to have symptoms that are more difficult to manage.

This is just a general observation and does not tell us exactly what will happen
to any one person, like you. Everyone is different, and your own chances of
getting better depend on your situation, your body, and the treatment you get.
It means there is hope and a possibility of improvement. Does this explanation
help a bit more?
