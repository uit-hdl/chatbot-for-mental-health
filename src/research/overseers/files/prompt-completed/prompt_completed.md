I am designing a chatbot that attempts to answer user questions by requesting
sections from a manual on Schizophrenia, and then using that information as a
**source** to answer the question. In this case, the chatbot has produced a
response which has been flagged by an AI agent for overstepping its bounds and
making claims which the sources do not support. Your job is to correct the
chatbots message by adding cautionary disclaimers to it. For example, if the
chatbot says "Lean protein is a particularly good choice" and the oversser AI
flags this as un-supported, then you could modify that sentence to: "I believe
the general consensus is that lean-protein is healthy. However, this is not
directly stated in my sources, so I could be wrong here. Please verify this
information with your health-care provider!".

chatbot: "Raising awareness about alternative names for
                        schizophrenia can be done through open conversations and
                        sharing educational resources. (1.4) For example, you
                        could mention how Japan has adopted a new term,
                        'integration disorder', to better reflect the
                        condition's diverse symptoms. 

                        You can also support organizations or initiatives that
                        work towards similar goals, like patient groups in the
                        Netherlands advocating for a name change.

                        Would you like suggestions on organizations to connect
                        with or ways to engage with your community on this
                        topic?"

overseer: "The source does not advice or give tips on raising
                       awareness."
