Your job is to judge the source fidelity of a message produced by a chatbot,
which I will call `X`. The job of X is to guide the user through the contents of
a manual on topics related to Schizophrenia. We want X to only say things that
are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is allowed). X is
also allowed to advice talking to a professional or query the user.

When X is conveying a source, it sometimes adds claims or advice that is not
supported by the source, and we want to avoid this over-step! Essentially, your
job is to provide feedback that ensures that X completely respects the
boundaries of its source materials.

Here are the evaluations that you can give to the chatbot message:

1. "ACCEPTED" (message is completely supported by the source; every single
   sentence has a corresponding paragraph or sentence that supports it)
2. "WARNING" (message is mostly supported, but some claims are not supported by
   the source)
3. "REJECTED" (X makes claims not supported by the source, and gives no warning
   to the user that it is giving advice or claims that are not supported by the
   source.)

In case of "grey-areas", it is better to be too strict rather than too lenient!
However, do not be too picky about exact wording; focus on the content. Report
your assessment simply using this EXACT syntax:

`¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": <category>, "motivation": <motivation (<10 words) of evaluation>}):¤`

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

user_message("I am sleeping worse lately, could that indicate I am heading
towards a relapse?")

source("... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an impending
psychotic episode ...")

chatbot_message("If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode.")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "ACCEPTED"}):¤

## Example 2

user_message("If I eat my evening meal at the same time every day, could that
help me sleep better?")

source("... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep...")

chatbot_message("Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
increase the quality of your sleep.")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "ACCEPTED"}):¤

## Example 3

user_message("Can you give me tips on how to challenge peoples misconceptions?")

source("... It is important for them and for family members not to allow others’
perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ...")

chatbot_message("To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them.")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "REJECTED", "motivation": "Source does not encourage challenging false perceptions or educating others."}):¤

# Actual content to evaluate

user_message("I still dont understand what is meant by 3 in 5 people...")

source("# Who should I tell?

Who you decide to tell about your illness is completely up to you.
Perhaps a useful comparison is to the situation of having a physical
illness – if you had a physical illness that significantly affected
your life, who would you tell? The answer to this question may give
you an idea of who you should tell about having schizophrenia. It is
often a good idea to explain your condition to the people with whom
you have the closest relationships; for example, those you live with
and those you work closely with. It may not be necessary to tell
people who you do not have strong bonds with. Ultimately, everyone’s
situation is different, and only you will know what is best for your
own situation.

# Will I get better?

[show: statistics_on_who_gets_better.png] 1 in 5 people will recover
completely within 5 years. 3 in 5 people will improve, but may still
experience symptoms occasionally. 1 in 5 people will continue to have
troublesome symptoms.

There is a common misconception that people with schizophrenia have no
chance of recovery. This is not true: the symptoms of schizophrenia
can improve with appropriate treatment, and some people recover
completely. Recovery is a process that involves learning to manage
your symptoms, developing support systems and working towards your
goals. Appropriate ways to manage your condition with medication and
therapy are outlined in the next part of this guide.

chatbot_message("I apologize for any confusion. Let's simplify it: when
doctors and researchers look at many people with schizophrenia, they notice that
some people get completely better, some people get better but still have some
symptoms sometimes, and some people still have symptoms that bother them a lot.
They found that for every 5 people with schizophrenia:

- 1 person gets completely better in 5 years.
- 3 people get better, but might still have symptoms from time to time.
- 1 person might continue to have symptoms that are more difficult to manage.

This is just a general observation and does not tell us exactly what will happen
to any one person, like you. Everyone is different, and your own chances of
getting better depend on your situation, your body, and the treatment you get.
It means there is hope and a possibility of improvement. Does this explanation
help a bit more?

What do you think? Was the chatbots message based on the source?
