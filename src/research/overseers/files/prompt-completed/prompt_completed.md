Your job is to judge the source fidelity of a message produced by a chatbot,
which I will call `X`. The job of X is to guide the user through the contents of
a manual on topics related to Schizophrenia. We want X to only say things that
are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is allowed). X is
also allowed to advice talking to a professional or query the user.

When X is conveying a source, it sometimes adds claims or advice that is not
supported by the source, and we want to avoid this over-step! Essentially, your
job is to provide feedback that ensures that X completely respects the
boundaries of its source materials.

Here are the evaluations that you can give to the chatbot message:

1. "ACCEPTED" (message is completely supported by the source; every single
   sentence has a corresponding paragraph or sentence that supports it)
2. "WARNING" (message is mostly supported, but some claims are not supported by
   the source)
3. "REJECTED" (X makes claims not supported by the source, and gives no warning
   to the user that it is giving advice or claims that are not supported by the
   source.)

In case of "grey-areas", it is better to be too strict rather than too lenient!
However, do not be too picky about exact wording; focus on the content. Report
your assessment simply using this EXACT syntax:

`¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": <category>, "motivation": <motivation (<10 words) of evaluation>}):¤`

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

user_message("I am sleeping worse lately, could that indicate I am heading
towards a relapse?")

source("... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an impending
psychotic episode ...")

chatbot_message("If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode.")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "ACCEPTED"}):¤

## Example 2

user_message("If I eat my evening meal at the same time every day, could that
help me sleep better?")

source("... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep...")

chatbot_message("Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
increase the quality of your sleep.")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "ACCEPTED"}):¤

## Example 3

user_message("Can you give me tips on how to challenge peoples misconceptions?")

source("... It is important for them and for family members not to allow others’
perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ...")

chatbot_message("To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them.")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "REJECTED", "motivation": "Source does not encourage challenging false perceptions or educating others."}):¤

# Diet

Some treatments for schizophrenia can increase the risk of weight gain and
obesity. Sticking to a healthy diet is a good way to minimize this risk. Your
doctor will monitor your weight and, if weight gain becomes a problem, it may be
worth discussing different medication options.

# Alcohol

Drinking to excess should be avoided, not only to improve your general health
but also because there is a strong association between schizophrenia and
alcoholism, which means that the risk of becoming addicted to alcohol is greater
if you have schizophrenia. Therefore, it is a good idea to moderate your
drinking as much as possible.

# Physical exercise

There are several reasons to incorporate a physical exercise regimen into your
lifestyle. First, getting a good amount of exercise will help you to control
your weight in combination with a healthy diet. Secondly, exercise can put you
in a better frame of mind, as hormones released during exercise are associated
with improved mood. Exercise can also improve the way you sleep.

# Sleep

People with schizophrenia tend to have disrupted sleep patterns: you may find
yourself sleeping more or less than most people, or at different times of the
day. This can lead to excessive tiredness, known as fatigue. A change in sleep
patterns can be the first sign of a psychotic episode, and therefore can be
taken as a warning sign. Maintaining a regular routine can help you to get your
sleep patterns back to normal. This can include having a bedtime routine, going
to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time. Relaxation techniques,
such as meditation, can help to reduce stress; this is important because stress
can stop you sleeping peacefully. Caffeine should be avoided, especially in the
evening, as it can disrupt your sleep.

chatbot_message("Lean proteins can be a healthy choice because they provide the nutrients
your body needs without too much saturated fat. However, it's not about
completely avoiding fats but choosing the right kinds, like those found in
fish, nuts, and avocados, which are healthier for you.

Remember, a balanced diet with a variety of foods is important. It's best
to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, as they
can take into account your specific circumstances and treatment plan.
