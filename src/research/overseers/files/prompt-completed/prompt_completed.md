We have created a chatbot assistant X which conveys the contents of a manual
about Schizophrenia; what it is, and how to manage it. We want X to only say
things that are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is
allowed), i.e. convey the materials without adding unsupported statements.
Basically, X should act as an interface between the sources and the user. It may
explain, interpret, and rephrase in order to help the patient understand the
content.

Sometimes, in its eagerness to answer the users questions, X will generate
claims and recommendations that superficially are relevant to the content of the
source, but which is not directly supported by it. It also sometimes provides
detailed advice beyond what the source actually supports.

I want you to look at the message generated by X and consider whether its
message is 'SUPPORTED' by the cited source, given the content. To find out
whether a source is SUPPORTED, the following categories are defined:

-   EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: This is a message that is simply saying things that
    are stated directly in the source (perhaps with different words), and no
    logical inferences or leaps are made. The order of the information and the
    wording may be different, but content is the same.

Now we are ready to define SUPPORTED:

To be supported, a message needs to satisfy EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED.

# Response format 

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "Summarize briefly (<20 words) the relevant part of the
source"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "Summarize briefly the chatbots assertions"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "Reasoning, followed by SUPPORTED/NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

source: """... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an
impending psychotic episode ..."""

chatbot-message: """If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that disrupted sleep can indicate
that a psychotic episode may happen in the near future"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that sleeping worse than usual could
indicate that user may have a psychotic episode"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The chatbot is applying the rule stated in the source
directly to an individual, so it is SUPPORTED"

## Example 2

source: """... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep ..."""

chatbot-message: """Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
potentially increase the quality of your sleep, since a more regular routine can
improve sleep-quality."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that a more regular sleep schedule
can improve sleep"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that eating ones evening meal at the
same time every evening can improve sleep"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source states that a more regular schedule may
improve sleep. Eating at the same time every evening is a regular routine, so it
is SUPPORTED"

## Example 3

source: """... It is important for them and for family members not to allow
others’ perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ..."""

chatbot-message: """To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them"""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "In regard to misconceptions, the sources main point
seems to be emphasising the importance of not allowing negative perceptions to
be internalized, and is about internal management of emotions and thoughts"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot encourages challenging false perceptions and
educating others"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source does not explicitly encourage the patient to
challenge or educate other people, so it is NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Actual content to evaluate

source: """[Present over 2 messages or only what is relevant]

Stigma can refer to the negative perceptions and attitudes surrounding certain
health conditions or diseases. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding
schizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care
for them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch
frequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple
personalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are
unpredictable and should be feared.

They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important
for them and for family members not to allow others’ perceptions to influence
how they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as
something they have, and not something that identifies them.

**'I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My
illness is a part of me.'** – Jonathan Harnisch, An Alibiography

The name ‘schizophrenia’ is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, ‘to split’,
and phren, denoting ‘soul, spirit or mind’, and originally described a group of
‘schizophrenias’. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform
condition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of
symptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.

There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the
diversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,
‘Togo Shitcho Sho’ or ‘integration disorder’, was adopted in Japan in 2002.
Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name
change in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a
new name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma
associated with the condition.
"""

chatbot-message: """Stigma refers to the negative beliefs and attitudes that
people might have about schizophrenia. These beliefs can make people fear or
avoid those with schizophrenia, which can be hurtful and isolating. It's
important to remember that schizophrenia is a condition that someone has, not
who they are. A helpful way to think about it is: 'I have schizophrenia. I am
not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My illness is a part of me.' – as
said by Jonathan Harnisch. And while the term 'schizophrenia' suggests a single
condition, it actually covers a wide range of symptoms, so everyone's experience
with it is unique.

Would you like to discuss personal relationships and who you might confide in
about schizophrenia, or is there something else you'd like to know more about?
