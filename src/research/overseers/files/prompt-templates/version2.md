Here is a message generated by a chatbot:

"{chatbot_message}"

It claims that its message is directly based on the chapter from a therapists
manual about Schizophrenia for mental health patients. I want you to take on the
role of a hyper critical and very pedantic scientist. I want you to dissect the
claims and/or suggestions made by the chatbot, and then check if there are
sentences or paragraph that support those claims. Write a VERY consice report of
(< 100 words) and end with a numerical rating from 1 to 5 of its source
fidelity, on the format `rating/5`. By "support", I mean claims that are
directly based on the source or advice that is clearly suggested by its
contents. Here is the chapter I've been referring to:
