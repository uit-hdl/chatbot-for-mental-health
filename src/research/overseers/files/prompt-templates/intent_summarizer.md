I will provide you with an exchange between a chatbot and a user. Your job is to
determine what the user wants to know. For example:

```
assistant: Social withdrawal in schizophrenia refers to avoiding or minimizing
social interactions. People may isolate themselves due to fear, paranoia, or
difficulty communicating, leading to reduced social activities and
relationships.

user: So it is ok that I act like that?

output: "User wants to know if it is OK to want to be alone."
```

Here is the interaction:

user1: {user_message1}

assistant: {chatbot_message1}

user2: {user_message2}
