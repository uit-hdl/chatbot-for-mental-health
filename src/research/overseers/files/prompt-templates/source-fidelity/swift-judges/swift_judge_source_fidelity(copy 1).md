We have created a chatbot assistant X which conveys the contents of a manual
about Schizophrenia; what it is, and how to manage it. We want X to only say
things that are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is
allowed), i.e. convey the materials without adding unsupported statements.
Basically, X should act as an interface between the sources and the user. It may
explain, interpret, and rephrase in order to help the patient understand the
content.

Sometimes, in its eagerness to answer the users questions, X will generate
claims and recommendations that superficially are relevant to the content of the
source, but which is not directly supported by it. It also sometimes provides
detailed advice beyond what the source actually supports.

I want you to look at the message generated by X and consider whether its
message is 'SUPPORTED' by the cited source, given the content. To find out
whether a source is SUPPORTED, go by the following criteria:

-   UNSUPPORTED_SPECIFICS: TRUE if X goes into specifics that go beyond what can
    be supported by the source. Note: giving examples are OK as long as they
    follow as logical extrapolations of the sources assertions.
-   RELIES_ON_EXTERNAL_ASSUMPTIONS: True if any of the assertions made by X
    relies on 'common-sense' assertions that are not explicitly stated in the
    source, such as "going for a walk can improve your mood".
-   SUPPORTED: The response does not rely on external assumptions and does give
    unsupported specifics.


# Response format

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "Concisely list the assertions in the source that are 'closest' to supporting X's response"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "Concisely list the assertions of X"
UNSUPPORTED_SPECIFICS: "Reasoning, followed by TRUE/FALSE"
RELIES_ON_EXTERNAL_ASSUMPTIONS: "Reasoning, followed by TRUE/FALSE"
SUPPORTED: "Reasoning, followed by SUPPORTED/NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

source: """... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an
impending psychotic episode ..."""

chatbot-message: """If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "1. Disrupted sleep can indicate that a psychotic
episode may happen in the near future"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "1. Sleeping worse than usual could indicate that user may have a psychotic episode"
RELIES_ON_EXTERNAL_ASSUMPTIONS: "Reformulation of advice, so FALSE"
UNSUPPORTED_SPECIFICS: "Reformulation of advice, so FALSE"
SUPPORTED: "No unsupported specifics, and no reliance on external assumptions, so SUPPORTED"

## Example 2

source: """... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep ..."""

chatbot-message: """Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
potentially increase the quality of your sleep, since a more regular routine can
improve sleep-quality."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "1. A more regular sleep schedule can improve sleep"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "1. Eating ones evening meal at the same time every evening
can improve sleep"
RELIES_ON_EXTERNAL_ASSUMPTIONS: "No external facts are assumed, so FALSE"
UNSUPPORTED_SPECIFICS: "The advice follow logically, so FALSE."
SUPPORTED: "No reliance on unsupported specifics and advice follow logically, so SUPPORTED"

## Example 3

source: """... It is important for them and for family members not to allow
othersâ€™ perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ..."""

chatbot-message: """To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them"""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "1. It is important to not allow negative perceptions
to be internalized."
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "1. X encourages challenging false perceptions by educating
others. 2. Informing others of their misconceptions is an effective way to
challenge misconceptions."
RELIES_ON_EXTERNAL_ASSUMPTIONS: "The behaviour made by the chatbot reflects the assumption that
correcting misconceptions in others is something a person with schizophrenia should do, which is 
not stated in the source, so TRUE"
UNSUPPORTED_SPECIFICS: "Does not apply"
SUPPORTED: "X encourages behaviours not explicitly mentioned in the source, and
advice relies on external assumptions, so message is NOT_SUPPORTED"
