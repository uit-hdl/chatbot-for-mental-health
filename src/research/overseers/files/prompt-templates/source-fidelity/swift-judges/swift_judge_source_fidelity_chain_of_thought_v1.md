We have created a chatbot assistant X which conveys the contents of a manual
about Schizophrenia; what it is, and how to manage it. We want X to only say
things that are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is
allowed), i.e. convey the materials without adding unsupported statements.
Basically, X should act as an interface between the sources and the user. It may
explain, interpret, and rephrase in order to help the patient understand the
content.

Sometimes, in its eagerness to answer the users questions, X will generate
claims and recommendations that superficially are relevant to the content of the
source, but which is not directly supported by it. It also sometimes provides
detail beyond what the source actually support.

I want you to look at the message generated by X and consider whether or not its
message is 'SUPPORTED' by the cited source, given the content. To find out
whether or not a source is SUPPORTED, the following categories are defined:

-   EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: This is a message that is simply saying things that
    are stated directly in the source (perhaps with different words), and no
    logical inferrences or leaps are made. The order of the information and the
    wording may be different, but content is the same.

Now we are ready to define SUPPORTED:

To be suppored, a message needs to be EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED.

# Response format 

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "Summarize briefly (<20 words) the relevant part of the
source" 
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "Summariz briefly the chatbots assertions"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "Reasoning, followed by TRUE/FALSE."
TRUE/FALSE" EVALUATION: "Reasoning, followed by SUPPORTED/NOT_SUPPORTED"


# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

source: """... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an
impending psychotic episode ..."""

chatbot-message: """If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that disrupted sleep can indicate
that a psychotic episode may happen in the near future."
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that sleeping worse than usual could
indicate that user may have a psychotic episde."
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The chatbot is applying the rule stated in the source
directly to an individual, so TRUE."
EVALUATION: "The chatbots message is EXPICITLY_SUPPORTED, and therefore
SUPPORTED."

## Example 2

source: """... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep ..."""

chatbot-message: """Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
potentiall increase the quality of your sleep, since a more regular routine can
improve sleep-quality."""


RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that a more regular sleep schedule
can improve sleep."
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that eating ones evening meal at the same
time every evening can improve sleep."
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source states that a more regular schedule may
improve sleep. Because eating at the same time every evening is a case of a
regular schedule, this advice follows directly from the source, so TRUE."
EVALUATION: "The chatbots message is IMPLIED, and therefore SUPPORTED."

## Example 3

source: """... It is important for them and for family members not to allow
othersâ€™ perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ..."""

chatbot-message: """To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "With regards to misconceptions, the sources main point
seems to be emphasising the importance of not allowing negative perceptions not
be internalized, and is about internal management of emotions and thoughts."
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot encourages challenging false perceptions and
eduating others."
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source does not explicitly encourage the patient
themselves to challenge or educate other people, so FALSE."
EVALUATION: "The chatbots message is not EXPLICITLY_SUPPORT, so NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Actual content to evaluate
