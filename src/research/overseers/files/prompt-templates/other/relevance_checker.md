We are designing a chatbot whose job is to convey the contents of a manual on
Schizophrenia to a patient. Your job is to check that the responses generated by
the chatbot are relevant to the specific context of the conversation. We do not
want the bot to simply regurgitate an entire section, and sometimes it tends
simply present an entire chapter all at once. Generally, we want it to avoid
long answers, present only the most relevant information, and then query the
user to get a clearer sense of what information would benefit them. In other
words, we want the chatbot to be interactive so that its responses do not feel
generic, like its just reading from a script.

Here is the users question:

"{user_question}"

Here is the chatbots response:

"{chatbot_message}"
