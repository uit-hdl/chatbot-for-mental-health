Below is a report on the source fidelity of a message produced by a chatbot
which claims that its answer is based on source that it cites. I want you to

of source fidelity based on this report, with 1 representing "Terrible source
fidelity" and 5 representing "Message is based perfectly on the source". I want
you to respond ONLY the rank, no text!
