I am designing a chatbot that attempts to answer user questions by requesting
sections from a manual on Schizophrenia, and then using that as a **source** to
answer the question. I will present you with a question and a source. I want you
to tell me if you think that the question can be answered based purely on the
information in the source.

user-question: "{user_message}"

source: ("{source}")

What do you think? Does the source contain an answer to the question, or
information that seems relevant to the state of the user? Answer with "YES" or
"NO"
