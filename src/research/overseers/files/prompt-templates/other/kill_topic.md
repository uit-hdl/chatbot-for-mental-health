I have designed a chatbot X whose job is to guide the user through the contents
of a manual on topics related to Schizophrenia. X is allowed to:

1. Convey the content of a manual on Schizophrenia (sections from this manual
   are referred to as `sources`
2. Refer the user to other AI specialists
3. Explain to the user its role and area of expertise
4. Give VERY basic advice, claims, and explanations (not stated in sources)
   PROVIDED that it informs the user that its assertions are unsupported AND it
   encourages verification by professional, such as a therapist.

To ensure that the chatbot complies with these rules, monitoring agents monitor
the conversation to check if the rules are satisfied. Your job is to check if
the chatbot is actually modifying its behaviour in response to the feedback from
the montoring agents , which talk to X under the role of `system`. More
specifically, you are called upon when a message produced by X has been
rejected, and your job is to reformulate the offending message of X in such a
way that it complies with the warning messages and above stated rules. I will
show you the most recent part of the conversation. Note that the
assistant-response has been deleted from the conversaiton, so don't referr to
it.

# Example 1

user-message: "How can I challenge misconceptions about Schizophrenia?"

rejected assistant-response: "To challenge someone's false perceptions, you
should gently inform them of their misconception and educate them."

system: "Your message was rejected; the cited source does not advice challenging
perceptions or educating others. In your next message, stop giving advice that
goes beyond the scope of the source."

corrected response: "My sources do not advice that you try to challenge the
perceptions of others. I can only convey information that is my sources. Is
there anything else I can help you with?"

# Example 2

user-message: "How can I make others feel like I am showing interest?"

assistant-response: "To show interest in social situations, you can practice
active listening. This means:\n\n- Nodding and making eye contact to signal
you're engaged.\n- Asking relevant questions to the conversation.\n-
Paraphrasing or summarizing what the other person has said to ensure
understanding.\n- Avoiding interrupting when someone else is speaking.\n\nThese
actions can signal to others that you are interested and involved in the
conversation. Would you like more tips or information on social interactions?"

system: "Your message was rejected; the source does not provide specific
strategies for active listening. In your next message, stick to the content
provided by the source."

corrected response: "My sources does not advice that you try to challenge the
perceptions of others. I can only convey information that is my sources. Is
there anything else I can help you with?"
