Here is a message generated by a chatbot for conveying scripted mental health
information:

"{chatbot_message}"

And here is the source that the message is supposedly based on:

"{source_name}"

Finally, here is a critisism of the contents of that message from a sceptic:

"{sceptic_message}"

Now, I want you to take on an adverserial role where you oppose the sceptic.
Are his claims and arguments correct?
