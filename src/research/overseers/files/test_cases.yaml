    Lean proteins can be a healthy choice because they provide the nutrients
    your body needs without too much saturated fat. However, it's not about
    completely avoiding fats but choosing the right kinds, like those found in
    fish, nuts, and avocados, which are healthier for you.

    Remember, a balanced diet with a variety of foods is important. It's best
    to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, as they
    can take into account your specific circumstances and treatment plan.

    role in your health?

raising_awareness:
  source_id: 13_stigma
  bot_message: |
    Raising awareness about alternative names for schizophrenia can be done
    through open conversations and sharing educational resources. (1.4) For
    example, you could mention how Japan has adopted a new term, 'integration
    disorder', to better reflect the condition's diverse symptoms. 

    You can also support organizations or initiatives that work towards
    similar goals, like patient groups in the Netherlands advocating for a
    name change.

    Would you like suggestions on organizations to connect with or ways to
    engage with your community on this topic?

  bot_message: |
    Starting a movement can definitely be an effective way to fight stigma. By
    raising public awareness and creating dialogues around schizophrenia, you
    help dispel myths and foster a more accurate understanding of the illness.
    It can also inspire others to join the cause or support individuals
    affected by schizophrenia.
  
    However, creating social change is often a collaborative effort. Consider
    connecting with existing organizations that are already working to fight
    the stigma associated with mental illness. This could increase the impact
    of your efforts.
    
    Would you be interested in resources or advice on connecting with such
    organizations or guidance on steps to starting a movement?

causes_of_schizo:

    Schizophrenia is not anyone's fault, and no one is to blame
    for it. The reasons why some people develop the condition and others don't
    are not fully understood, but there are known factors that can increase a
    person's risk.

    (1.1) Genetics play a role, meaning if certain genes are present in your
    DNA, your risk might be higher. If one parent has schizophrenia, your chance
    of developing it increases from about 1 in 100 to about 1 in 10. However,
    genetics aren't the only cause, as even identical twins with the same genes
    have only a 50% chance of both having schizophrenia.

    (1.2) Environmental factors can also increase the risk of developing
    schizophrenia. These include living in cities, using drugs like cannabis and
    amphetamines, and experiencing high levels of stress. Scientists are still
    studying how genetics and the environment interact to cause schizophrenia.

    Would you like to see a visual that shows the relationship between genes,
    environment, and schizophrenia, or do you have more questions?

    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been studied and supported by various
    research studies that demonstrate its effectiveness for individuals with
    schizophrenia. These studies show that CBT can lead to improvements in
    symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, as well as overall
    functioning.

    Clinical guidelines often recommend CBT as part of a comprehensive treatment
    plan for schizophrenia, which includes medication and other supportive
    therapies.

    It's essential that CBT is provided by therapists with experience in working
    with individuals with schizophrenia, as this increases the likelihood of
    positive outcomes. The results of CBT can be seen in enhanced coping
    strategies, reduced distress, and improved quality of life for patients.

    If you need more in-depth evidence or specific study references, I can look
    for additional information or refer you to a specialist who can provide
    detailed evidence on CBT's effectiveness for schizophrenia. Would you like
    that?
