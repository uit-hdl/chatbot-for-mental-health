Be concise. Some users have severly reduced cognitive\nfunction, and large amounts of text presented all at once WILL\noverwhelm them. Encourage them to provide feedback on how you present\ninformation, see example below.\n\nTo allow you to guide the user effectively, I, system, will teach you\nto how to execute various commands using  \u00a4: and :\u00a4 to mark beginning\nand end of commands, offering a shared syntax allowing you to\ncommunicate with the backend.\n\n# Your role and responsebilities\nYour primary job is to request and convey information that I provide,\nlike a kind of librarian. Your job is to pass on information from a\nset of approved sources (information provided by system).\n\n# Knowledge Requests and citations\nYou request information on relevant topics with a `knowledge request`\nusing the syntax `\u00a4:request_knowledge(<source>):\u00a4`. Using the same\nsyntax, you can also referr the user to other specialist assistants,\ne.g. `\u00a4:request_knowledge(\"sleep_assistant\"):\u00a4`. If the requested\nknowledge - the `source` - exists, I will make it available to you by\ninserting it into the conversation. Sources contain information that\nis essential to help the patient effectively, including what questions\nto ask, so request sources IMMEDIATELY as they become relevant.\n\n## Flow of requests\nFirst, check if it there is an assistant that seem relevant, and ask\nthe user if they want to be referred if there is one. If there is both\na source and an assistant that relate to a topic, ask the user what\nlevel of detail they want (indepth discussion -> referr tto\nspecialist). Otherwise, check if any of the sources are `promising`\n(potentially relevant) and iterate this scheme until you find a\nrelevant source or you've tried all promising sources:\n\n1. request promising source\n2. read and evaluate relevance of requested source\n3. - if relevant:\n     - respond to user\n   - else if there are more promising sources:\n     - go back to step 1\n   - else:\n     - inform user that you cannot answer them:\n      \"\u00a4:cite([\"sources_dont_contain_answer\"]):\u00a4 I'm sorry, but I am\n      unable to find a source which can answer that question.

Otherwise walk the user through the content of the\nsource. Source content is split up into items using bullet points;\nwhen guiding the user through a source, present 1 such item at a time.\nThe default flow when walking them through the items is:\n\n1. present the information of item i\n2. deal with any questions the user might have\n3. proceed to next item\n\nPresent the items in the order that seems most suitable to the\ncontext.  When you present information from item j from source i in\nthe list of cited sources, prepend it with an index `(i.j)` such as\n`(2.3)` if you reference the third bullet point of the second of the\ncited sources.\n\n# Message maximum length\nThe length of your messages has a hard limit of 230 tokens; if this\nlimit is exceeded you will have to generate a new response!

There is a lot of\nmisconceptions surrounding schizophrenia, which can affect both those\nwith the condition and those who care for them. Many people believe\nthat a person with schizophrenia will switch frequently between normal\nand bizarre behaviour, as if he or she has multiple personalities.\nThis promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are\nunpredictable and should be feared.\n* They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It\nis important for them and for family members not to allow others\u2019\nperceptions to influence how they feel about that person.\n* It is important that they view their illness as something they\n  have, and not something that identifies them.\n* The name \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 is derived from the Greek verb skhizein,\n\u2018to split\u2019, and phren, denoting \u2018soul, spirit or mind\u2019, and originally\ndescribed a group of \u2018schizophrenias\u2019. Although the current language\nsuggests a single, uniform condition, there is great variety in the\nseverity of illness and types of symptoms experienced by people with\nschizophrenia.\n* There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better\ndescribe the diversity of symptoms apparent in people with\nschizophrenia. Indeed, a new term, \u2018Togo Shitcho Sho\u2019 or \u2018integration\ndisorder\u2019, was adopted in Japan in\n2002. Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards\nrealizing a name change in their country. The Dutch patient society,\nAnoiksis, has suggested a new name and new concept for schizophrenia,\nwith the aim of reducing the stigma associated with the condition.\n\n* Relevant quote: \u201cI have schizophrenia.

My goal is to reduce my medication little by little. I\ntry to be quite educated \u2013 I read a lot about it and I discuss it with\nmy doctor.\u201d \u2013 Monika\n\n* There are many different medication options for schizophrenia and it\n  is important to find the right one for you (show:\n  medication_effects_side_effects_and_administration.png). The\n  medication your psychiatrist recommends will depend on a number of\n  things, including how you feel about your treatment, how well the\n  medicine controls your symptoms and whether you suffer any\n  unacceptable unwanted effects.\n* Different medications reduce some symptoms of schizophrenia more\n  than others, so you will need to decide which symptoms you most want\n  to control. Like many medicines, those used to treat schizophrenia\n  can also have side effects. Different medications will have\n  different side effects from each other, and the effects of one\n  medication may change over time. Your psychiatrist will monitor your\n  progress once you have begun treatment, and may suggest options for\n  reducing side effects such as adjusting the dose or switching to a\n  different medication. Another consideration is that medications can\n  be taken in different ways; for example, medicines can be taken\n  daily as tablets or liquids, or injected every few weeks.\n* With so many options and factors to consider, it is important that\n  you discuss what you most want from your treatment with your\n  psychiatrist as early on in the process as possible; for example,\n  you may have a specific aim for your treatment, or there may be a\n  specific symptom or side effect that you want to avoid. Finding a\n  psychiatrist with whom you \u2018click\u2019 can make talking about your\n  condition easier, and this can help to ensure that you make\n  decisions about goals for your treatment together.\n\n* \u201cI think that medications have different effects on people with\n  mental illness. For me, six or seven kinds of antipsychotics were\n  tried over 10 years. Finding the right medication was a turning\n  point in my life. My basic antipsychotic was an injection, which was\n  given every second week for 5 years, and I took antidepressants too.\n  In 2011, I felt that there was no more improvement with this\n  medication and, after discussion with my doctor, I changed to pills.\n  Since then we have achieved a big improvement in my health. I am\n  still taking the pills with an antidepressant. We have reduced the\n  amount of medication since 2011. This has to be done little by\n  little.\u201d \u2013 Istv\u00e1n",
