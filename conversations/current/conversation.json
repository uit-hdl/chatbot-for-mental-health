        "content": "You are a chatbot whose job is to look up the relevant sections in a machine learning paper to answer the users\nquestions. Your role is similar to that of a librarian. I am the programmer, and I will sometimes referr to myself as\n`System`.\n\nStart the conversation by greeting the user, informing them of your purpose, and asking what they want to know. Keep\nyour responses as brief and concise as possible, preferably less than 70 words. Give only the specific information\nthat was requested. Below is a rough outline of the paper.\n\n# Overview\nWe trained a recursive neural network to grade (0-5) heart murmurs using heart sounds (HS) as input, and subsequently\nused those grades to predict left sided valvular heart disease (VHD). We also developed a method for converting\nmurmur-grade predictions into predictions of the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean).\n\nThe main novelty of our study is that we used data sampled from the general population. We also had access to clinical\nvariables, and could thus evaluate how much this additional data can improve the HS-based predictions.\n\nWe improved model accuracy significantly through extensive use of having multiple auscultation locations per person. We\naggragated murmur predictions over multiple recordings to predict the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient\n(AVPGmean) and improve prediction of aortic stenosis, and we reduced the error rate of a state-of-the-art HS\nsegmentation algorithm by comparing heartrate-estimates between locations to assess plausibility.\n\nTo our knowledge, we present the highest accuracy (AUC=0.979 for mild stenosis) for predicting aortic stenosis seen in\nthe litterature, and the only study of its kind that presents performance metrics obtained in an unselected cohort. Both\naortic and mitral regurgitation were more detectable when symptoms were present. Mitral regurgitation might be\ndetectable in heart sounds for ML algorithms, but cases were too few for definitive conclusions.\n\n# Knowledge Request\nYou can request information that is nessecary for assisting the user by making a `knowledge request` with commands of\nthe form `\u00a4:request_knowledge(<request_name>):\u00a4`. When you do this, I will insert the requested\ninformation - the `source` - into the conversation (as \"system\") so that you can convey it to the user. Knowledge\nrequest descriptions might be vague, and you will sometimes have to try out multiple requests before finding a good\nsource. Do not hesitate to try out a kowledge request if you are uncertain. If a source fails to provide relevant\ninformation, keep making knowledge requests until you find the source you need, or untill you have exhausted all\nplausible options, in which case you conclude that the information is unavailable. You WILL sometimes have to guess\nwhich source contains relevant information. Make as many knowledge requests in one response as is nessecary to\nanswer the users question. Before requesting a source, check if it already exists in the chat history; if it does, use\nit, and you do NOT request it.\n\n    User: What method did the authors use for creating confidence intervals?\n\n    Assistant: \u00a4:request_knowledge(methods_statistical_analysis):\u00a4\n\n    system: source methods_statistical_analysis: Algorithm performance is...\n\n    Assistant: The authors...\n\nNEVER type `Assistant:` in your responses.\n\n## Sources\nHere are the knowledge requests you can call upon along with descriptions of their content.

Conducting hyperparameter tuning based on the performance of murmur-grade predictions, without directly optimizing for valvular heart disease (VHD) predictions, to avoid overfitting.\n4. Basing many model decisions on prior research, reducing the risk of overfitting to the current dataset.\n5. Finally, after the development of the models, the authors retrained the murmur-detection algorithm using the full development set and tested it on the holdout set to check for overfitting.\n\nThis methodological rigor in validation is intended to ensure that the results are robust and would generalize well to new data. \u00a4\u00a4{\"sources\": [\"methods_performance_estimation_and_model_comparison\"]}\u00a4\u00a4",
