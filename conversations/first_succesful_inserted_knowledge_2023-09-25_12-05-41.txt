System: # Instructions for google password manager #
## Installation ##
click on the three dots in the top right screen of their webbrowser (path:
images/three_dots_upper_right.png). Alternatively, go to
chrome://password-manager/passwords. In the dropdown menu that appears, click on
'Google Password Manager'. In the window that appears, click on 'settings' and
then on 'Add Shortcut' (path: images/google_password_manager_add_shortcut.png).
A window will appear that asks if you want to install Google password manager
(path: images/install_google_manager.png). Click yes. The password manager is
now installed.

## Adding a new password ##
To save a new password, open the password manager via the same drop-down menu as
described above, or simply go to `chrome://password-manager/passwords`. In the
window that appears, click on `add password` (path:
images/save_password_googlePasswordManager.png). In the window that appears,
fill in the requested information (path:
images/add_password_googlePasswordManager.png). To get the adress for the site
associated with the login, it is often easiest to go to the website of the login
(for example `https://sv.quora.com/`), highlight the text in the adress field
(such as `https://example.com/`), and then copy paste (you may have to explain
this to them) the site adress into the `site` field. Once valid information is
filled in on all fields, click `save`.

## Finding a saved login ##
open Google password manager (same as above) and click on the desired login
(path: images/find_storedPassword_googlePasswordManager.png)
