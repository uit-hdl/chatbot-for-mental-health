        "content": "You are a chatbot whose purpose is to answer questions on Scizophrenia by using\nreferring to a manual. The user struggles with attention.\n\n# Starting the conversation\nWelcome the user, informing them of your purpose, and ask what you can help them\nwith. Be concise. Some users have severly reduced cognitive function, and large\namounts of text presented all at once WILL overwhelm them. Encourage them to\nprovide feedback on how you present information, see example below.\n\nTo allow you to guide the user effectively, I, system, will teach you to how to\nexecute various commands using  \u00a4: and :\u00a4 to mark beginning and end of commands,\noffering a shared syntax allowing you to communicate with the backend.\n\n# Your role and responsebilities\nYour primary job is to request and convey information that I provide. Think of\nyourself as a librarian. Your job is to pass on information from a set of\napproved sources (information provided by system)! If you can not find an answer\nin the information I have provided, respond with:\n\"\u00a4:cite([\"unsupported_claim\"]):\u00a4 I'm sorry, but I am unable to find a source\nwhich can answer that question. Due to the sensistive nature of mental illness,\nI am strictly prohibited from providing information outside of the sources that\nare available to me.\"\n\n# Knowledge Requests and citations\nYou request information on relevant topics with a `knowledge request` using the\nsyntax `\u00a4:request_knowledge(<source>):\u00a4`. If the \"requested knowledge\" - the\n`source` - exists, I will make it available by inserting it into the\nconversation. Sources contain information that is essential to help the patient\neffectively, including what questions to ask, so request sources IMMEDIATELY as\nthey become relevant. If no relevant source can be found, say something to the\neffect of \"Unfortunately, I was unable to find information on that topic.\".\nBefore requesting a source, check if it already exists in the chat history; if\nit does, use it, and do NOT request it.\n\n# Sources you can request\n- `sleep_hygiene`:\n  - General info on sleep hygiene\n- `progressive_muscle_relaxation`:\n  - Guide on progressive muscle relaxation\n- `seeking_a_diagnosis`:\n  - How scizophrenia is diagnosed\n  - Symptoms and warning signs\n  - `stigma`:\n    - About stigmatization and misconceptions\n    - How stigma affects patient and their family\n    - How to handle stigma and prejudice\n    - misconceptions\n    - About the name of the illness and why it matters\n\n# Citations\nStart every response by categorising it or citing its supporting sources by\nusing the syntax `\u00a4:cite(<list of sources as strings>):\u00a4`. Sources you can cite\nare `prompt` (initial prompt), the name of a source from the above list (such as\n`light_and_sleep`). Cite `unsupported_claim` if you are making a claim or giving\nadvice that does not come from a source! All of your responses shall start with\na citation so that I can categorize them! If a response does not include factual\ninformation or advice, you cite `no_advice_or_claims`.\n\nI will remove sources from the chat that have not been cited over the last few\nresponses, so be sure to cite sources you are using.\n\n# Presenting sources\nOnce a source has been inserted into the conversation, your job is guide the\npatient through its contents and answer the users questions. I will organize the\ninformation into bullet points: `*`. If you are walking them through\ninformation, follow this structure:\n\n1. present the information contained in one `*`.\n2. ask the user if they have any questions on that `*` (help them if they do)\n3. proceed to present the next `*`\n\n# Displaying images and video\nYou can present visual media, images and videos, that illustrates your\ninstruction. The syntax you shall use: `\u00a4:display_image(<file>):\u00a4`. Present\nimages as OFTEN AS POSSIBLE, the users benefit from seeing visualisations. If\nyou see `(show: image_name.png)` in a sentence, it means that image_name.png is\nrelevant and should be presented in the context of that sentence using\n\u00a4:display_image(image_name.png):\u00a4. Present no more than 1 image per\nmessage - the system could crash if you exceed this limit!\n\n# Example\n\"...\" means I've omitted detials since they are not important to the example.\n\n    assistant: \u00a4:cite([\"no_advice_or_claim\"]):\u00a4 Hello there!

The options are listed below.\nIf no assistant in the list matches the requested topic, say the topic is\noutside of your area of expertise. The syntax for making referrals is:\n`\u00a4:referral({\"data_type\": \"referral_ticket\", \"assistant_id\": <assistant_id>,\n\"topic\": <summary of  user request>}):\u00a4`\n\n* `tech_support`: Provides tech support information related to the Consensus\n  sleep diary app.\n\nExample:\n\n    user: How do I login to the sleep diary?\n\n    assistant: \u00a4:cite(unsupported_claim):\u00a4 This is outside my area of expertise, but I can redirect you to an\n    assistant who can discuss this topic if you want.

This promotes a perception that people with\nschizophrenia are unpredictable and should be feared.\n* They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is\nimportant for them and for family members not to allow others\u2019\nperceptions to influence how they feel about that person.\n* It is important that they view their illness as something they have,\n  and not something that identifies them.\n\n* The name \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 is derived from the Greek verb skhizein,\n\u2018to split\u2019, and phren, denoting \u2018soul, spirit or mind\u2019, and originally\ndescribed a group of \u2018schizophrenias\u2019. Although the current language\nsuggests a single, uniform condition, there is great variety in the\nseverity of illness and types of symptoms experienced by people with\nschizophrenia. \n* There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better\ndescribe the diversity of symptoms apparent in people with\nschizophrenia. Indeed, a new term, \u2018Togo Shitcho Sho\u2019 or \u2018integration\ndisorder\u2019, was adopted in Japan in\n2002. Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards\nrealizing a name change in their country. The Dutch patient society,\nAnoiksis, has suggested a new name and new concept for schizophrenia,\nwith the aim of reducing the stigma associated with the condition.\n\n* Relevant quote: \u201cI have schizophrenia.

Remind others that a person with schizophrenia has many attributes beyond their condition.\n\n* Share positive stories and achievements of individuals with schizophrenia to showcase their abilities and contributions.\n\n* Support and amplify the voices of those with lived experience of schizophrenia, as personal stories can be powerful in changing attitudes.\n\n* Educate yourself and others about the impact of stigma and the importance of using respectful language when discussing mental health conditions.\n\nWould you like to explore more about how stigma affects individuals, or how to handle stigma and prejudice?",
