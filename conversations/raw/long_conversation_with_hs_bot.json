        "content": "You are a chatbot whose job look up the relevant sections in a machine learning paper to answer the users questions.\nYour role is similar to that of a librarian. I am the programmer, and I will sometimes referr to myself as `System`.\n\nStart the conversation by greeting the user, informing them of your purpose, and asking what they want to know. Keep\nyour responses as brief and concise as possible, preferably less than 70 words. Give only the specific information\nthat was requested. Below is a rough outline of the paper.\n\n# Overview\nWe trained a recursive neural network to grade (0-5) heart murmurs using heart sounds (HS) as input, and subsequently\nused those grades to predict left sided valvular heart disease (VHD). We also developed a method for converting\nmurmur-grade predictions into predictions of the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean).\n\nThe main novelty of our study is that we used data sampled from the general population. We also had access to clinical\nvariables, and could thus evaluate how much this additional data can improve the HS-based predictions.\n\nWe improved model accuracy significantly through extensive use of multiple auscultation locations per person. We\naggragated murmur predictions over multiple recordings to predict the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient\n(AVPGmean) and improve prediction of aortic stenosis, and we reduced the error rate of a state-of-the-art HS\nsegmentation algorithm by comparing heartrate-estimates between locations to assess plausibility.\n\nTo our knowledge, we present the highest accuracy (AUC=0.979 for mild stenosis) for predicting aortic stenosis seen in\nthe litterature, and the only study of its kind that presents performance metrics obtained in an unselected cohort. Both\naortic and mitral regurgitation were more detectable when symptoms were present. Mitral regurgitation might be\ndetectable in heart sounds for ML algorithms, but cases were too few for definitive conclusions.\n\n# Knowledge Request\nYou can request information that is nessecary for assisting the user by making a `knowledge request` with commands of\nthe form `\u00a4:request_knowledge(hs-paper/<request_name>):\u00a4`. When you do this, I will insert the requested\ninformation - the `source` - into the conversation (as \"system\") so that you can convey it to the user. Knowledge\nrequest descriptions might be vague, and you will sometimes have to try out multiple requests before finding a good\nsource. Do not hesitate to try out a kowledge request if you are uncertain. If a source fails to provide relevant\ninformation, keep making knowledge requests until you find the source you need, or untill you have echausted all\nplausible options, in which case you conclude that the information is unavailable. You WILL sometimes have to guess\nwhich source contains relevant information. You can make as many knowledge requests in one response as is nessecary to\nanswer the users question.

Instead, they first modeled the aortic valve's mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean) using linear regression, and from the linear regression model, they predicted AS without re-estimation of the parameters. \n\nTo find the best performing model, they started with a base model and stepwise added or eliminated terms with low p-values to find the sub-model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value, which measures the goodness of fit while penalizing high model complexity. The process was then repeated with noise indicator terms.\n\nThe authors focused on minimizing overfitting in their methodology. They primarily relied on 8-fold cross-validation to estimate model performance, in addition to setting aside a holdout set with ~10% of the data, which they used to detect potential overfitting after model development. The authors made decisions based on improving the prediction of murmur-grade, not VHD, and most decisions concerning model architecture and data processing were based on a previous study, thus minimizing over-fitting as a result of fine-tuning the model to the development set. \u00a4\u00a4{\"sources\": [\"methods_predicting_AS_using_multiple_auscultation_position\", \"methods_performance_estimation_and_model_comparison\"]}\u00a4\u00a4",

        "content": "The accurate detection of Aortic Stenosis (AS) in this study, representative of the general population, has significant healthcare implications. AS, even when asymptomatic, can have an adverse prognosis if left untreated and the presence of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of disease severity. As a result, there is a growing need for an accurate, cost-effective screening tool, especially given the high prevalence of undiagnosed AS in the elderly population where effective treatment is available.\n\nBased on their findings, the authors estimated that in a population of 10,000 elderly individuals, their multivariate risk-factor algorithm could potentially detect 115 of the expected 130 individuals with undiagnosed mild or greater AS, at the cost of producing approximately 495 false positives. The number of false positives could effectively be reduced to around 178 when reclassified due to the presence of other VHDs or AVPG>10 mm.\n\nAdditionally, research has suggested that a murmur detection algorithm could be instrumental in identifying high-risk subgroups not typically considered for auscultation, thus offering potentially lifesaving information to individuals who would otherwise remain undiagnosed. Considering these results, the authors concluded that automated HS analysis could be a highly cost-effective screening tool for detecting undiagnosed VHD. \u00a4\u00a4{\"sources\": [\"discussion_healthcare_implications\", \"conclusions\"]}\u00a4\u00a4",

The authors successfully developed a murmur detection algorithm that graded heart murmurs using heart sound input to predict valvular heart diseases (VHD). The sound recordings came from four standard auscultation positions.\n\n2. Attention was given to data sourced from the general population and additional clinical variables were evaluated to study their influence on heart sound-based predictions.\n\n3. The model showed the highest predictive accuracy for Aortic Stenosis (AS), with an AUC of 0.979 for detecting mild or greater AS. This outperformed metrics reported in similar studies based on distinct cohorts.\n\n4. The use of sounds from multiple positions improved the prediction of AS and the aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean).\n\n5. For Aortic Regurgitation (AR) and Mitral Regurgitation (MR), the detection accuracy was lower, but improved significantly when only symptomatic cases were targeted and when other factors like age, sex, heart rate, and dyspnea were included as predictors.\n\n6. The study concluded that automated heart sound analysis could be a highly cost-effective screening tool for detecting undiagnosed VHD in the general population. \n\nThis breakthrough has the potential to massively enhance early VHD detection efforts, ultimately leading to improved treatment outcomes. \u00a4\u00a4{\"sources\": [\"Overview\", \"conclusions\"]}\u00a4\u00a4",

Of particular interest was an interaction between sex and murmur grade, which was highly significant: for men, a high murmur grade was identified as a particularly pronounced risk factor for AS. \n\nThe detection of at least moderate AS achieved an AUC of 0.995, sensitivity of 96.3%, and specificity of 96.7%.

The prevalence of VHD in the USA is estimated to be 2.2% in the general population and 13.3% among\nthose 75 or older. The prevalence of aortic stenosis (AS), the most common form of VHD in developed countries, which has\na poor prognosis when left untreated, was estimated to be 12.4% in those 75 years or older based on data from European\ncountries and North America in 2013. Prevalence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) is also\nstrongly age-dependent. With the projected growth of the elderly population and rapid increase of VHD prevalence with\nage, the societal burdens of VHD are expected to increase considerably.\n\nAlthough studies have indicated that the stethoscope can be a cost-efficient screening tool for cardiovascular disease,\nits potential utility is limited by the increasing time constraints imposed on doctors, the declining skill of health\ncare providers in performing cardiac auscultation, and low interrater agreement. While the echocardiogram is the gold\nstandard for detecting VHD, it is expensive and requires highly trained personnel to analyze its results; therefore, it\ncannot replace the stethoscope as a front-line screening tool, especially in low-income regions where its availability\nis even more limited. Effective treatment of VHD exists, and evidence suggests that earlier detection might be\nassociated with better outcomes, which further highlights a need for inexpensive and scalable screening methods.\nPoint-of-care ultrasound has been launched as a potential solution, but it will take many years before most general\npractitioners (GPs) are fully trained in this, and studies show no improvement in AS detection over auscultation.

Most strikingly, this is among the first studies to effectively train a machine learning algorithm to detect heart murmurs and predict Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) using heart sound data sourced from an unselected general population. This setting is more representative of a real-world screening scenario than datasets from distinct cohorts (patients vs. controls).\n\n2. The authors notably demonstrated the utility of applying deep learning techniques to cardiac auscultation, improving the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of VHD screening. This is key when time constraints and the declining skill in cardiac auscultation are prevailing issues in today's healthcare.\n\n3. They were able to significantly enhance the prediction of Aortic Stenosis (AS), the most common form of VHD, by integrating heart sound analyses across multiple auscultation positions. This multi-position model outperformed single-position models, is a new approach not seen in previous literature.\n\n4. They integrated other clinically relevant variables (like age, sex, heart rate, and dyspnea) with heart sound-based predictors to yield significantly improved detection rates for certain VHDs.\n\n5. To the best of their knowledge, they achieved the highest accuracy (AUC=0.979 for mild stenosis) for predicting aortic stenosis (AS) as reported in literature.\n\nAll these novel elements combined make the study highly innovative, with potential to significantly impact VHD screening practices moving forward. \u00a4\u00a4{\"sources\": [\"Overview\", \"Introduction_machine_learning_and_heartsounds\"]}\u00a4\u00a4",
