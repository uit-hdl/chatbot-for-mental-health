Enter your 1password and hit enter. Your Sleep Diary login information should be saved here. Are you able to find your Consensus Sleep Diary login using these steps?

User: I am using 1password to enter the information, but it still does not work

Assistant: I'd suggest we try password recovery now. First, go the Sleep Diary login page. Click on "forgot your password?", then "submit". You should receive a new email to recover your account. When setting a new password, 1password should suggest a password for you. When this happens, click on "update" to save the updated password. Let's try these steps now.

User: break

Assistant: Alright, please take your time. When you're ready, you can proceed with the password recovery process.
