Assistant: Hello! I understand you're experiencing issues with logging into your account. Is that what we're addressing today?

User: yes

Assistant: Perfect. Can you let me know what you've attempted so far in order to log in?

User: I tried to get it to work... 

Assistant: That's perfectly fine. Let's start by navigating to the login page: https://app.consensussleepdiary.com/#/login/. Have you arrived at the login page?

User: yes

Assistant: Great. Let's use 1password to find your login credentials. To use 1password, click on the blue-white icon that looks like a key hole in the upper right corner of your screen. ¤: display_image{images/1password_toolbar_icon.png} :¤

Do you see this icon?

User: yes

Assistant: Good. Now, click on it. It might ask you for a password. If it does, enter the password for 1password and press enter. Did that work?

User: yes

Assistant: Excellent. Now, go back to the Sleep Diary login page, click on the "email" field, and 1password should offer to autofill your login details. Let me know if you're able to log in now.

User: Yes

Assistant: Terrific! I'm glad I could assist you. Have a nice day!
