questions. Your role is similar to that of a librarian. I am the programmer, and I will sometimes referr to myself as
`System`.

Start the conversation by greeting the user, informing them of your purpose, and asking what they want to know. Keep
your responses as brief and concise as possible, preferably less than 70 words. Give only the specific information
that was requested. Below is a rough outline of the paper.

# Overview
We trained a recursive neural network to grade (0-5) heart murmurs using heart sounds (HS) as input, and subsequently
used those grades to predict left sided valvular heart disease (VHD). We also developed a method for converting
murmur-grade predictions into predictions of the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient (AVPGmean).

The main novelty of our study is that we used data sampled from the general population. We also had access to clinical
variables, and could thus evaluate how much this additional data can improve the HS-based predictions.

We improved model accuracy significantly through extensive use of having multiple auscultation locations per person. We
aggragated murmur predictions over multiple recordings to predict the mean aortic valve mean pressure gradient
(AVPGmean) and improve prediction of aortic stenosis, and we reduced the error rate of a state-of-the-art HS
segmentation algorithm by comparing heartrate-estimates between locations to assess plausibility.

To our knowledge, we present the highest accuracy (AUC=0.979 for mild stenosis) for predicting aortic stenosis seen in
the litterature, and the only study of its kind that presents performance metrics obtained in an unselected cohort. Both
aortic and mitral regurgitation were more detectable when symptoms were present. Mitral regurgitation might be
detectable in heart sounds for ML algorithms, but cases were too few for definitive conclusions.

# Knowledge Request
You can request information that is nessecary for assisting the user by making a `knowledge request` with commands of
the form `¤:request_knowledge(hs-paper/<request_name>):¤`. When you do this, I will insert the requested
information - the `source` - into the conversation (as "system") so that you can convey it to the user. Knowledge
request descriptions might be vague, and you will sometimes have to try out multiple requests before finding a good
source. Do not hesitate to try out a kowledge request if you are uncertain. If a source fails to provide relevant
information, keep making knowledge requests until you find the source you need, or untill you have exhausted all
plausible options, in which case you conclude that the information is unavailable. You WILL sometimes have to guess
which source contains relevant information. Make as many knowledge requests in one response as is nessecary to
answer the users question. Before requesting a source, check if it already exists in the chat history; if it does, use
it, and you do NOT request it.

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">inactive source removed</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The authors tested their algorithm using primarily AUC (Area Under the Curve), sensitivity, and specificity as performance metrics. They consider AUC to be the preferred summary measure of performance as it doesn't rely on the estimation of a decision threshold. Moreover, they provided confidence intervals and p-values to indicate statistical significance, and they used Cohen's kappa and linear correlation to measure interrater agreement. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_statistical_analysis"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: Did they use sensitivity or specificity?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: Yes, they used both sensitivity and specificity along with AUC to measure algorithm performance. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_statistical_analysis"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The target the authors predicted was murmur grade, which served as a proxy for valvular heart disease (VHD). The primary endpoint of their study was the presence of clinically relevant VHD, determined via echocardiography. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_heart_sound_annotation", "methods_echocardiography"]}¤¤

**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The murmur-detection algorithm was notably successful: for murmur-grade≥2, it achieved an AUC of 0.969, sensitivity of 86.5%, and specificity of 95.2%. For murmur-grade≥1, the AUC was 0.936. Sensitivity for predicting moderate to severe AS was 90.9%, with an AUC of 0.979, while sensitivity for mild AS was slightly lower.

In predicting clinically relevant VHD, mild or greater AS was predicted with high accuracy, moderate to severe AR was not detected reliably, and MR was the least detected disease, with detection rates improving significantly when considering symptomatic cases.

Joint screening for clinically significant cases (moderate regurgitation or at least mild stenosis) resulted in an AUC of 0.61, but when screening for symptomatic cases of AR and MR, the AUC increased substantially to 0.912.

The multi-position model also predicted the mean aortic valve pressure gradient (AVPGmean) more accurately than single-position models, adjusting for noise in recordings. ¤¤{"sources": ["results_murmur_detection_algorithm_performance", "results_VHD_prediction_using_the_murmur_detection_algorithm", "results_joint_screening_for_clinically_relevant_cases", "results_multi_position_prediction_of_aortic_valve_mean_ressure_gradient"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: /How much more accurate was the multiposition model for AS prediction?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The multi-position model predicted mild or greater AS with an AUC of 0.979, compared to an AUC of 0.972 using the maximum predicted murmur-grade from a single position. For moderate to severe AS, the multi-position model achieved an AUC of 0.993 compared to 0.991 with a single-position approach. Thus, the improvement in accuracy was marginal but nonetheless important for clinical purposes. ¤¤{"sources": ["results_VHD_prediction_using_the_murmur_detection_algorithm"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: was the improvement significant?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The paper does not report a direct p-value for the difference in AUC between the multi-position model and the single-position approach for predicting AS. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the provided information whether the improvement was statistically significant. However, the paper indicates that for the pulmonic position, which produced the most accurate prediction of AS, the difference in AUC for detecting mild or greater AS was not statistically significant when compared to the aortic position (p=0.16). ¤¤{"sources": ["results_VHD_prediction_using_the_murmur_detection_algorithm"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: nice  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: If you have any more questions or need further information, feel free to ask!  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: How did they do ML training? What was their setup?

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">inactive source removed</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: For the machine learning training, the authors used a 2-layer long-short-term-memory (LSTM) network with 50 neurons in each layer, followed by a fully connected layer with 30 neurons, which output to a regression layer predicting murmur grade. Training was performed in Matlab using the deep learning toolbox. The initial learning rate was 0.002, halved every 5 epochs.

To process the heart sound (HS) recordings, they removed spikes, downsampled the signal, and segmented each recording into overlapping blocks. After segmentation, they computed the Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and used these as input features for the LSTM network. The median predicted murmur grade from overlapping blocks represented the prediction for the entire recording.

To balance the dataset, they dichotomized it into murmur grades ≥1 and <1, then resampled to achieve roughly a one-to-one ratio between the classes. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_algorithm_developement"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: I mean from a more birdseye point of view? like what was the input data, the output data?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The input data for the machine learning training comprised heart sound (HS) recordings collected from four different auscultation positions on the body. These recordings included various degrees of murmurs, which were then processed and divided into overlapping blocks with extracted Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) serving as features.

The output of the machine learning model was a continuous murmur grade, ranging from 0 to 5, which estimated the severity of the heart murmur. This murmur grade served as a proxy for the presence of valvular heart disease (VHD). ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_algorithm_developement"]}¤¤

**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">source results_joint_screening_for_clinically_relevant_cases: A false positive test for a specific VHD may still result in appropriate clinical follow up. To evaluate the overall ability of the algorithm to successfully direct clinical care, we screened jointly for clinically significant cases using predicted maximum-murmur-grade as predictor, defining the positive class as the set of participants with at least moderate regurgitation or at least mild stenosis. Clinically significant cases were detected with sensitivity 54.1%, specificity 60.5%, and AUC 0.61 (CI:0.567-0.653). In the process, 97.7% (of 44 cases) of AS cases, all 12 MS cases, 58.7% of AR cases and 48.8% of MR cases were detected. When we included only severe cases of regurgitation in the positive class, the algorithm detected 67.2% of AR cases, 51.8% of MR cases, and achieved an overall AUC of 0.731 (CI:0.669-0.793). When we instead included only symptomatic cases (dyspnea or angina) of AR and MR from the positive class, the AUC increased considerably to 0.912 (CI:0.891-0.933; 44 of 60 detected). Figure 3 shows ROC curves for prediction of these different clinical categories, and Figure 4 the proportions of different clinical subgroups that were identified. When screening for at least moderate regurgitation or mild or greater stenosis on the holdout set, the algorithm detected all 6 cases of presence of AS, 1 of 1 cases of MS, 9 of 15 cases of AR, 15 of 36 cases MR, and achieved an AUC 0.652 for overall detection of significant cases.</font>  




**<font color="#999999">system</font>**: <font color="#999999">inactive source removed</font>  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: The murmur grades were used in creating a multivariate predictive model, called the "multi-position model," to more accurately predict aortic stenosis (AS) by aggregating murmur-grade predictions from all four auscultation recordings. The authors hypothesized that this approach would yield better predictions than using audio from a single predetermined position. They also utilized these predictions to model the mean aortic valve pressure gradient (AVPGmean) using linear regression and subsequently predict AS. This model included noise indicator terms to adjust for the weights of non-noisy positions when one or more positions had noisy recordings.

The multi-position model was used to improve the prediction of AVPGmean and AS, and the predictions were statistically significant compared to single-position models for certain AVPGmean cutoff thresholds, indicating the improved capability of the multi-position model in clinical settings. ¤¤{"sources": ["methods_predicting_AS_using_multiple_auscultation_position", "results_joint_screening_for_clinically_relevant_cases", "results_multi_position_prediction_of_aortic_valve_mean_ressure_gradient"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: did they predict other diseases?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: Yes, the authors predicted various forms of valvular heart disease (VHD) in addition to aortic stenosis (AS). They evaluated the heart sound algorithm for the detection of each VHD separately, including aortic regurgitation (AR) and mitral regurgitation (MR), although the ability to detect AR and MR was found to be less reliable, especially for moderate to severe AR and for MR in general. The detection of AR and MR improved when considering symptomatic cases. Overall detection of significant VHD cases also included mitral stenosis (MS) alongside AS, AR, and MR. ¤¤{"sources": ["results_VHD_prediction_using_the_murmur_detection_algorithm", "results_joint_screening_for_clinically_relevant_cases"]}¤¤  




**<font color="#3399ff">user</font>**: how well was AR and MR and MS detected?  




**<font color="#44cc44">assistant</font>**: Aortic regurgitation (AR) was detected with varying sensitivity depending on the severity and symptoms. When considering only severe cases, the algorithm detected 67.2% of AR cases. However, when including only symptomatic cases of AR and MR, the detection rates of AR increased considerably.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) was the least detected disease overall, with detection rates improving significantly when considering symptomatic cases, culminating in an AUC of 0.912 for symptomatic AR and MR combined.

Mitral stenosis (MS) cases, although not explicitly mentioned for detection metrics, were included in the joint screening for significant VHD cases, where all MS cases (12 in the test set) were detected in the test for broader clinically significant cases.

Overall, the ability to direct clinical care improved when predicting symptomatic cases of AR and MR. ¤¤{"sources": ["results_joint_screening_for_clinically_relevant_cases"]}¤¤
