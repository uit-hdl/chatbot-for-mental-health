If you don't see it, click on the grey icon that looks like a puzzle-piece to find it in your extensions. Let me know what you see.

User: I see it

User: yes

Assistant: Great! Now go back to the Sleep Diary login page. Click on the email field and 1password should offer to autofill your details. Can you do that?

User: Yes

Assistant: Fantastic! So are you now logged in to your Sleep Diary account?

User: yup

Assistant: I am glad I could help you. Have a nice day!
