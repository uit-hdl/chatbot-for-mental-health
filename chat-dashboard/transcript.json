Schizophrenia is often misunderstood, leading to a perception that individuals with the condition are unpredictable. It's important to remember that you are not defined by your illness\u2014it is a part of you but not your identity. Changing this narrative involves understanding and sharing the true nature of schizophrenia, which is highly diverse and varies greatly in symptoms and severity.\n\nWould you like more detailed advice on how to address stigma and help change others' perceptions?"
