My goal is to reduce my medication little by little. I\ntry to be quite educated \u2013 I read a lot about it and I discuss it with\nmy doctor.\u201d \u2013 Monika\n\n# Deciding on a medication\n\nThere are many different medication options for schizophrenia and it is\nimportant to find the right one for you [show\nmedication_effects_side_effects_and_administration.png]. The medication your\npsychiatrist recommends will depend on a number of things, including how you\nfeel about your treatment, how well the medicine controls your symptoms and\nwhether you suffer any unacceptable unwanted effects.\n\nDifferent medications reduce some symptoms of schizophrenia more than\nothers, so you will need to decide which symptoms you most want to\ncontrol. Like many medicines, those used to treat schizophrenia can\nalso have side effects. Different medications will have different side\neffects from each other, and the effects of one medication may change\nover time. Your psychiatrist will monitor your progress once you have\nbegun treatment, and may suggest options for reducing side effects\nsuch as adjusting the dose or switching to a different medication.\nAnother consideration is that medications can be taken in different\nways; for example, medicines can be taken daily as tablets or liquids,\nor injected every few weeks.\n\nWith so many options and factors to consider, it is important that you\ndiscuss what you most want from your treatment with your psychiatrist\nas early on in the process as possible; for example, you may have a\nspecific aim for your treatment, or there may be a specific symptom or\nside effect that you want to avoid. Finding a psychiatrist with whom\nyou \u2018click\u2019 can make talking about your condition easier, and this can\nhelp to ensure that you make decisions about goals for your treatment\ntogether.\n\n\u201cI think that medications have different effects on people with mental\nillness. For me, six or seven kinds of antipsychotics were tried over\n10 years. Finding the right medication was a turning point in my life.\nMy basic antipsychotic was an injection, which was given every second\nweek for 5 years, and I took antidepressants too. In 2011, I felt that\nthere was no more improvement with this medication and, after\ndiscussion with my doctor, I changed to pills. Since then we have\nachieved a big improvement in my health. I am still taking the pills\nwith an antidepressant. We have reduced the amount of medication since\n2011. This has to be done little by little.\u201d \u2013 Istv\u00e1n\n\n# Sticking to medication\n\nOnce you start receiving medication, it can be tempting to think that\nyour lack of symptoms means that you don\u2019t need the medication any\nmore. If you start skipping doses, however, it is likely that your\nsymptoms will return; up to 80% of people who stop taking their\nmedication relapse within 1 year.4 In some instances, suddenly\nstopping your medication can be harmful. Therefore you should always\ntalk with your psychiatrist before making any decisions about your\ntreatment. Above all, if you decide to stop taking your medication, it\nis important that you tell someone.\n\n# Coming of medication\n\n[QUERY FOR RELEVANCE] There may be some special situations when it\nmight be necessary to stop taking your medication; for example, during\npregnancy or while breastfeeding. In these cases, the benefits to you\nof the medication will be assessed against its risks to the baby. You\nmay be advised to discontinue your medication long enough before you\nbecome pregnant for the medicine to be cleared from your system;\nhowever, this will depend entirely on your individual situation, so it\nis crucial that you discuss with your psychiatrist any plans you have\nfor starting or expanding your family.\n\n\u201cMedication is important because it protects me from having a\npsychotic episode. I take my pills every night if I don\u2019t take them I\nknow that there\u2019s a possibility of a psychotic episode.\u201d \u2013 Ronan\n"
