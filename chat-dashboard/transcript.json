It's not a choice or a result of someone's actions; the exact causes are unknown, but it involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nThe condition is often misunderstood due to sensationalized media portrayals, leading to stigmatization and myths about the illness.

People may believe individuals with schizophrenia are unpredictable due to the incorrect idea that they switch between normal and bizarre behaviors.\n\nSuch views can lead to self-stigmatization, where individuals with schizophrenia may begin to view themselves through the lens of such misconceptions. It's crucial for them and their family members to see the illness as just one aspect of the person, not their entire identity.\n\nThe term 'schizophrenia' originates from Greek words meaning 'to split' and 'mind,' leading some to mistakenly think it involves a split personality. In reality, schizophrenia is diverse in how it affects individuals, both in severity and symptoms.\n\nEfforts are being made to change the name and concept of schizophrenia in some countries, like Japan and the Netherlands, to help reduce stigma and better reflect the diversity of experiences by those with the condition.\n\nWould you like to know more about handling stigma or any other topic related to schizophrenia?"
