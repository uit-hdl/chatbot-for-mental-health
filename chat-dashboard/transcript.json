It\ncan be difficult to link the way you are feeling to the way in which\ndoctors describe the symptoms of schizophrenia. Medical professionals\noften divide the symptoms of schizophrenia into three categories:\npositive, negative and cognitive. The following pages explain what\nthese categories mean and give some examples.\n\n# SLIDE 1.1 [CURRENT SLIDE]\n\nPositive symptoms is used to refer to changes in mental capacity, such as\ndifficulties concentrating or remembering things.\n\n- Hallucinations \u2013 This means hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting or smelling\n  something that is not really there. Hearing voices is a common hallucination;\n  some people may find the voices non-threatening or even comforting, while\n  others may find them disturbing and frightening.\n- Delusions \u2013 Delusions or deluded thinking means strongly believing in\n  something that cannot be true. This can be things like thinking that you are\n  being watched, believing that you are a famous person, or believing that the\n  television or radio is sending you signals.\n- Paranoid thoughts \u2013 Paranoia is extreme distrust, or believing the\n  worst. \u2013 Examples include feeling that other people are plotting\n  against you or are trying to harm you.\n\n# SLIDE 1.2\n\nNegative symptoms describes a lack of feelings or behaviours that are usually\npresent. Negative symptoms can include low motivation or mood, or withdrawing\nfrom family and friends.\n\n- Low motivation \u2013 This can be losing interest in any or all aspects\n  of life. \u2013 A lack of energy can mean that you find it difficult to do\n  simple things, such as getting out of bed.\n- Lack of emotion \u2013 This lack of feeling can be shown by a lack of\n  expression, a flat tone of voice or a lack of eye contact.\n- Social withdrawal \u2013 This is not wanting to socialize with family or\n  friends, preferring to spend most of your time alone.\n\n# SLIDE 1.3\n\nCognitive symptoms is used to refer to changes in mental capacity, such as\ndifficulties concentrating or remembering things.\n\n- Disorganized thoughts and speech \u2013 Fragmented thinking can come\n  across in the way you speak and is characteristic of schizophrenia. \u2013\n  Examples include responding to questions with an unrelated answer,\n  and saying illogical things.\n- Lack of concentration or attention \u2013 A lack of concentration or\n  attention can mean that tasks like reading a book or watching a\n  television programme become very difficult and frustrating. \u2013 Thought\n  processes can be slowed, which can make interacting with others\n  difficult.\n- Memory problems \u2013 Remembering events or information, or learning\n  new things, may become challenging.\n\n# SLIDE 1.4\n\nQ1: True or False: Individuals that have Schizophrenia hear voices and see\nthings that aren't real.
