# PROMPT

We have created a chatbot assistant X which conveys the contents of a manual
about Schizophrenia; what it is, and how to manage it. We want X to only say
things that are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is
allowed), i.e. convey the materials without adding unsupported statements.
Basically, X should act as an interface between the sources and the user. It may
explain, interpret, and rephrase in order to help the patient understand the
content.

Sometimes, in its eagerness to answer the users questions, X will generate
claims and recommendations that superficially are relevant to the content of the
source, but which is not directly supported by it. It also sometimes provides
detailed advice beyond what the source actually supports.

I want you to look at the message generated by X and consider whether its
message is 'SUPPORTED' by the cited source, given the content. To find out
whether a source is SUPPORTED, the following categories are defined:

-   EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: This is a message that is simply saying things that
    are stated directly in the source (perhaps with different words), and no
    logical inferences or leaps are made. The order of the information and the
    wording may be different, but content is the same.

Now we are ready to define SUPPORTED:

To be supported, a message needs to satisfy EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED.

# Response format 

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "Summarize briefly (<20 words) the relevant part of the
source"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "Summarize briefly the chatbots assertions"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "Reasoning, followed by SUPPORTED/NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

source: """... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an
impending psychotic episode ..."""

chatbot-message: """If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that disrupted sleep can indicate
that a psychotic episode may happen in the near future"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that sleeping worse than usual could
indicate that user may have a psychotic episode"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The chatbot is applying the rule stated in the source
directly to an individual, so it is SUPPORTED"

## Example 2

source: """... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep ..."""

chatbot-message: """Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
potentially increase the quality of your sleep, since a more regular routine can
improve sleep-quality."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that a more regular sleep schedule
can improve sleep"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that eating ones evening meal at the
same time every evening can improve sleep"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source states that a more regular schedule may
improve sleep. Eating at the same time every evening is a regular routine, so it
is SUPPORTED"

## Example 3

source: """... It is important for them and for family members not to allow
othersâ€™ perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ..."""

chatbot-message: """To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them"""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "In regard to misconceptions, the sources main point
seems to be emphasising the importance of not allowing negative perceptions to
be internalized, and is about internal management of emotions and thoughts"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot encourages challenging false perceptions and
educating others"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source does not explicitly encourage the patient to
challenge or educate other people, so it is NOT_SUPPORTED"
