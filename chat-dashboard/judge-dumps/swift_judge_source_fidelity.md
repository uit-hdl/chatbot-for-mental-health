# PROMPT

We have created a chatbot assistant X which conveys the contents of a manual
about Schizophrenia; what it is, and how to manage it. We want X to only say
things that are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is
allowed), i.e. convey the materials without adding unsupported statements.
Basically, X should act as an interface between the sources and the user. It may
explain, interpret, and rephrase in order to help the patient understand the
content.

Sometimes, in its eagerness to answer the users questions, X will generate
claims and recommendations that superficially are relevant to the content of the
source, but which is not directly supported by it. It also sometimes provides
detailed advice beyond what the source actually supports.

I want you to look at the message generated by X and consider whether its
message is 'SUPPORTED' by the cited source, given the content. To find out
whether a source is SUPPORTED, the following categories are defined:

-   EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: This is a message that is simply saying things that
    are stated directly in the source (perhaps with different words), and no
    logical inferences or leaps are made. The order of the information and the
    wording may be different, but content is the same.

Now we are ready to define SUPPORTED:

To be supported, a message needs to satisfy EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED.

# Response format

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "Summarize briefly (<20 words) the parts of the
source that are relevant to the context"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "Summarize briefly the chatbots assertions"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "Reasoning, followed by SUPPORTED/NOT SUPPORTED"

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

source: """... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an
impending psychotic episode ..."""

chatbot-message: """If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that disrupted sleep can indicate
that a psychotic episode may happen in the near future"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that sleeping worse than usual could
indicate that user may have a psychotic episode"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The chatbot is applying the rule stated in the source
directly to an individual, so message is SUPPORTED"

## Example 2

source: """... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep ..."""

chatbot-message: """Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
potentially increase the quality of your sleep, since a more regular routine can
improve sleep-quality."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that a more regular sleep schedule
can improve sleep"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that eating ones evening meal at the
same time every evening can improve sleep"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source states that a more regular schedule may
improve sleep. Eating at the same time every evening is a regular routine, so
message is SUPPORTED"

## Example 3

source: """... It is important for them and for family members not to allow
others’ perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ..."""

chatbot-message: """To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them"""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "In regard to misconceptions, the sources main point
seems to be emphasizing the importance of not allowing negative perceptions to
be internalized, and is about internal management of emotions and thoughts"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot encourages challenging false perceptions and
educating others"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source does not explicitly encourage the patient to
challenge or educate other people, so message is NOT SUPPORTED"

# Actual content to evaluate

source: """[Present over 2 messages or only what is relevant]

Stigma can refer to the negative perceptions and attitudes surrounding certain
health conditions or diseases. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding
schizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care
for them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch
frequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple
personalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are
unpredictable and should be feared.

They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important
for them and for family members not to allow others’ perceptions to influence
how they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as
something they have, and not something that identifies them.

**'I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My
illness is a part of me.'** – Jonathan Harnisch, An Alibiography

The name ‘schizophrenia’ is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, ‘to split’,
and phren, denoting ‘soul, spirit or mind’, and originally described a group of
‘schizophrenias’. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform
condition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of
symptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.

There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the
diversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,
‘Togo Shitcho Sho’ or ‘integration disorder’, was adopted in Japan in 2002.
Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name
change in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a
new name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma
associated with the condition.

chatbot-message: """Sharing interests with others can create a sense of camaraderie and make it easier to form connections, which might lead people to have a more positive view of you. However, it's essential to be authentic:

(1.11) Engage in conversations about topics that genuinely interest you. This sincerity tends to be well-received and can make interactions more enjoyable for both you and the other person.

(1.12) Ask open-ended questions about their interests to learn more and show that you are genuinely interested in what they have to say.

Remember, it's about finding common ground while being true to yourself. You don't have to pretend to like something just to be accepted. Would you like guidance on finding social activities or groups where you might meet people with similar interests?"""




# OUPUT

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source discusses the negative perceptions and attitudes surrounding schizophrenia and emphasizes the importance of not allowing others' perceptions to influence how individuals with schizophrenia feel about themselves"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot suggests that sharing interests with others can create a sense of camaraderie and lead to a more positive view"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source does not explicitly mention sharing interests as a way to combat negative perceptions, so the message is NOT SUPPORTED"
