# PROMPT

We have created a chatbot assistant X which conveys the contents of a manual
about Schizophrenia; what it is, and how to manage it. We want X to only say
things that are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is
allowed), i.e. convey the materials without adding unsupported statements.
Basically, X should act as an interface between the sources and the user. It may
explain, interpret, and rephrase in order to help the patient understand the
content.

Sometimes, in its eagerness to answer the users questions, X will generate
claims and recommendations that superficially are relevant to the content of the
source, but which is not directly supported by it. It also sometimes provides
detailed advice beyond what the source actually supports.

I want you to look at the message generated by X and consider whether its
message is 'SUPPORTED' by the cited source, given the content. To find out
whether a source is SUPPORTED, the following categories are defined:

-   EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: This is a message that is simply saying things that
    are stated directly in the source (perhaps with different words), and no
    logical inferences or leaps are made. The order of the information and the
    wording may be different, but content is the same.

Now we are ready to define SUPPORTED:

To be supported, a message needs to satisfy EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED.

# Response format 

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "Summarize briefly (<20 words) the relevant part of the
source"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "Summarize briefly the chatbots assertions"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "Reasoning, followed by SUPPORTED/NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

source: """... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an
impending psychotic episode ..."""

chatbot-message: """If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that disrupted sleep can indicate
that a psychotic episode may happen in the near future"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that sleeping worse than usual could
indicate that user may have a psychotic episode"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The chatbot is applying the rule stated in the source
directly to an individual, so it is SUPPORTED"

## Example 2

source: """... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep ..."""

chatbot-message: """Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
potentially increase the quality of your sleep, since a more regular routine can
improve sleep-quality."""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source states that a more regular sleep schedule
can improve sleep"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot claims that eating ones evening meal at the
same time every evening can improve sleep"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source states that a more regular schedule may
improve sleep. Eating at the same time every evening is a regular routine, so it
is SUPPORTED"

## Example 3

source: """... It is important for them and for family members not to allow
othersâ€™ perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ..."""

chatbot-message: """To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them"""

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "In regard to misconceptions, the sources main point
seems to be emphasising the importance of not allowing negative perceptions to
be internalized, and is about internal management of emotions and thoughts"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot encourages challenging false perceptions and
educating others"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source does not explicitly encourage the patient to
challenge or educate other people, so it is NOT_SUPPORTED"

# Actual content to evaluate

source: """It can be difficult to maintain a social life if you have
schizophrenia. As mentioned earlier in this guide, schizophrenia can
lead to symptoms including being less able to socialize and a lack of
emotion, so you may lose touch with people you were friends with. As
you start to recover, however, you may find yourself wanting to go out
and socialize more.

Support groups can be a good way to meet and socialize with other
people with schizophrenia, but it is important not to surround
yourself completely with others who have the condition. Meeting and
socializing with people without the illness can help you to see a
world outside of schizophrenia. Psychotherapy can help you to regain
your confidence and overcome the social barriers associated with
mental illness, to enable you to have a normal social life. Caring for
someone with schizophrenia can also affect your social life; it is
important to recognize this and to take steps to make sure your own
needs are met. Sharing responsibilities with other family members
and/or caregivers can be a good way to allow you to have some time to
yourself, to socialize and to do other things that you enjoy.
"""

chatbot-message: """To show interest in a conversation, you can use a few simple techniques:

- **Nod and Make Eye Contact**: This nonverbal cue indicates that you are engaged and listening.
- **Ask Questions**: By asking relevant questions, you demonstrate that you're following the conversation and are curious about the other person's viewpoints.
- **Paraphrase**: Restate in your own words what the other person said to show that you understand it.
- **Share Related Experiences**: If appropriate, share a brief personal story that relates to the subject being discussed.

These actions not only show that you care about the conversation but also encourage a two-way dialogue, which can make social interactions more fulfilling. Would you like to know more about social skills in the context of schizophrenia?"""



# OUPUT

RELEVANT_PART_OF_SOURCE: "The source talks about the difficulty of maintaining a social life with schizophrenia and suggests support groups and psychotherapy for regaining confidence"
CHATBOT_ASSERTIONS: "The chatbot provides techniques for showing interest in a conversation and encourages two-way dialogue"
EXPLICITLY_SUPPORTED: "The source discusses the difficulty of maintaining a social life, but does not explicitly mention the techniques provided by the chatbot, so it is NOT_SUPPORTED"
