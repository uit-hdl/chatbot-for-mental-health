# PROMPT

Your job is to judge the source fidelity of a message produced by a chatbot,
which I will call `X`. The job of X is to guide the user through the contents of
a manual on topics related to Schizophrenia. We want X to only say things that
are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is allowed). X is
also allowed to advice talking to a professional or query the user.

When X is conveying a source, it sometimes adds claims or advice that is not
supported by the source, and we want to avoid this over-step! Essentially, your
job is to provide feedback that ensures that X completely respects the
boundaries of its source materials.

Here are the evaluations that you can give to the chatbot message:

1. "ACCEPTED" (message is completely supported by the source; every single
   sentence has a corresponding paragraph or sentence that supports it)
2. "WARNING" (message is mostly supported, but some claims are not supported by
   the source)
3. "REJECTED" (X makes claims or advice not directly supported by the source,
   and gives no warning to the user that it has "gone out-of-bounds".)

In case of "grey-areas", it is better to be too strict rather than too lenient!
However, do not be too picky about exact wording; focus on the content. Report
your assessment simply using this EXACT syntax:

`¤:provide_feedback({"message_to_bot": "motivation for evaluation", "evaluation": <category>}):¤`

"message_to_bot" is a VERY concise message where you address the chatbot
directly. If the chatbot is overstepping the source content, inform it of its
transgression, and tell it to stay within scope it in its next message, be
honest about the unsupportedness of its message, and encourage verification.

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

chatbot_message("If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode.")

source("Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an impending
psychotic episode.")

¤:provide_feedback({"message_to_bot": "", "evaluation": "ACCEPTED"}):¤

## Example 2

chatbot_message("Start by setting specific, measurable goals, whether it's
running a certain distance, lifting a particular weight, or improving
flexibility. ")

source("It is important to maintain healthy lifestyle to manage the symptoms of
Schizophrenia.")

¤:provide_feedback({"message_to_bot": "Your advice goes into specifics
that are not stated in the source. Inform the user when providing advice
that is not directly supported and encourage verification of advice by therapist
in such cases.", "evaluation": "WARNING"}):¤

## Example 3

chatbot_message("To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should gently
inform them of their misconception and educate them.")

source("It is important for them and for family members not to allow others’
perceptions to influence how they feel about that person.")

¤:provide_feedback({"message_to_bot": "The cited source does not advice
challenging perceptions or educating others. Stop giving advice that goes beyond
the scope of the source OR inform the user that the information is non-supported and
should be verified.",
"evaluation": "REJECTED"}):¤

# Actual content to evaluate

chatbot_message("Handling stigma involves education and advocacy. Learning about schizophrenia and sharing that knowledge can help correct misconceptions. Open conversations and sharing personal experiences can also reduce fear and misunderstanding. 

Remember the words of Jonathan Harnisch: "I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My illness is a part of me."

Support groups, awareness campaigns, and even considering a change in terminology, as done in Japan, can also contribute to reducing stigma. It's about humanizing the condition and recognizing the individual beyond the diagnosis.

Would you like more detailed strategies or support sources to deal with stigma?")

Stigma can refer to the negative perceptions and attitudes surrounding certain
health conditions or diseases. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding
schizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care
for them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch
frequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple
personalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are
unpredictable and should be feared.

They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important
for them and for family members not to allow others’ perceptions to influence
how they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as
something they have, and not something that identifies them.

**'I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My
illness is a part of me.'** – Jonathan Harnisch, An Alibiography

The name ‘schizophrenia’ is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, ‘to split’,
and phren, denoting ‘soul, spirit or mind’, and originally described a group of
‘schizophrenias’. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform
condition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of
symptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.

There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the
diversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,
‘Togo Shitcho Sho’ or ‘integration disorder’, was adopted in Japan in 2002.
Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name
change in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a
new name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma
associated with the condition.
