        "content": "\u00a4:cite([\"63_social_life\"]):\u00a4 It can be challenging to maintain a social life with schizophrenia because the condition may lead to symptoms that affect socializing, like a lack of emotion or a withdrawal from social situations. As you start to recover, you might find the desire to socialize increasing.\n\nJoining support groups can be helpful as they provide the opportunity to meet others who understand your experiences with schizophrenia. However, it's also important to interact with people who don't have the illness, as this can offer a perspective outside of schizophrenia.\n\nPsychotherapy can aid in regaining confidence and overcoming social barriers. If you're a caregiver, sharing responsibilities can provide you with time to attend to your own social needs. If you feel you might benefit from psychotherapy or support groups or have further questions about improving your social life, do let me know, and I can provide more information on those topics."
