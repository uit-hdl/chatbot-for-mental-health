While it used to be classified into subtypes, such as paranoid, disorganized, and catatonic schizophrenia, this categorization is no longer used in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Instead, the current understanding focuses on schizophrenia as a single diagnosis that includes a range of symptoms that can vary widely from person to person.\n\nIf you have further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!"
