¤:cite(["61_personal_relationships"]):¤ Managing relationships when dealing with schizophrenia is a dual effort involving both the individual with the illness and their family members. Here are some practical steps for patients and family members:

1. **Educate yourselves about schizophrenia**:
   - Patients: Explain the illness to friends and family to foster understanding.
   - Family Members: Try to understand your family member's behavior and the nature of their experiences.

2. **Be honest in communication**:
   - Patients: Share your feelings and boundaries clearly.
   - Family Members: Discuss your fears and hopes openly.

3. **Agree on boundaries**:
   - Patients: Communicate your needs and limits to those close to you.
   - Family Members: Respect the wishes of your family member with schizophrenia as much as possible.

4. **Build trust**:
   - Patients: Trust that your family wants the best for you.
   - Family Members: Demonstrate your compassion and commitment to the person's well-being.

5. **Don't be ashamed**:
   - Patients: Remember that your illness is not your fault, and there is no shame in it.
   - Family Members: Caring for someone with schizophrenia is an act of love and should not be seen as shameful.

6. **Learn from others**:
   - Both Patients and Family Members: Participate in support groups to gain insights from individuals in similar situations.
