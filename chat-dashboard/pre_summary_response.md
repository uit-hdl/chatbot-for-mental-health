¤:cite(["53_psychotherapy"]):¤ The right psychotherapy for you depends on your individual needs, preferences, and specific situation. Below are some common types of psychotherapy that may be considered for someone with schizophrenia:

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Aims to change unhealthy thought and behavior patterns by identifying goals and practicing tasks between sessions.
- **Group Therapy:** Involves therapy in a social setting, which can be comforting when sharing thoughts with others who have faced similar experiences.
- **Family-Focused Therapy:** Helps the whole family communicate better and build a supportive environment.

Before choosing a type of therapy, consider the following questions to ask your potential therapist:

- What type of therapy do you offer?
- Do you have experience with schizophrenia?
- How long do sessions last and how often are they held?
- What results can I expect and when?
- What are the costs involved?

It's crucial to find a therapist you trust and feel comfortable with to ensure the best possible outcome. Always discuss any new therapy approaches with your healthcare team before starting them.
