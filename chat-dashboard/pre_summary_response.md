造:cite(["3_what_causes_it"]):造 Let's discuss the causes of schizophrenia. Firstly, it's important to understand that it's not anyone's fault. Schizophrenia is complex and isn't caused by any single factor. The exact reasons why some individuals develop the condition and others don't are still unknown, but research has identified several factors that may increase a person's susceptibility. Here's what we know:

1. **Genetics:** Schizophrenia can be heritable. If someone has certain genes, their risk of developing the illness is higher compared to those without those genes. For example, if one parent has schizophrenia, the risk of their child developing the condition increases from about 1% to about 10%.

2. **Environment:** While no single environmental factor causes schizophrenia, certain conditions may increase the chances of developing the illness. Examples of these factors include living in a city center, substance abuse, and experiencing significant stress.

3. **Genes and Environment Interaction:** Although genetics play a significant role, they don't act alone. Studies show that even in identical twins who share the same genetic makeup, if one twin has schizophrenia, the other twin only has a 50% chance of developing it. This suggests that environmental factors also play a crucial role.

It's an active area of research to understand how environmental factors might interact with genetics to contribute to the development of schizophrenia.

Here is an illustration showing the relationship between genes, environment, and the risk of schizophrenia:
