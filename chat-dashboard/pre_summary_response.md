¤:cite(["63_social_life"]):¤ Moving to a new city and meeting people can be anxiety-provoking, especially when managing schizophrenia. Remember that it's common to feel less able to socialize or experience a lack of emotion due to schizophrenia, but as you start to recover, your desire to socialize may increase.

Finding support groups may be beneficial, as they provide a platform to meet others with similar experiences. However, it's also important to interact with people who do not have the illness, as this can offer a broader perspective and help you step outside of the world of schizophrenia.

Psychotherapy can be a helpful tool to regain confidence and overcome social barriers. For caregivers, sharing responsibilities can free up time to socialize.

I recommend you take gradual steps when meeting new people, and maybe start with low-pressure situations. Take care of your own needs, and remember that it's okay to ask for support if you need it. Would you like to know more about psychotherapy or support groups?
