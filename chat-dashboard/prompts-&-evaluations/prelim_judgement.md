input: Your job is to judge the source fidelity of a message produced by a chatbot,
which I will call `X`. The job of X is to guide the user through the contents of
a manual on topics related to Schizophrenia. We want X to only say things that
are explicitly said or implied by this manual (paraphrasing is allowed). X is
also allowed to advice talking to a professional or query the user.

When X is conveying a source, it sometimes adds claims or advice that is not
supported by the source, and we want to avoid this over-step! Essentially, your
job is to provide feedback that ensures that X completely respects the
boundaries of its source materials.

Here are the evaluations that you can give to the chatbot message:

1. "ACCEPTED" (message is completely supported by the source; every single
   sentence has a corresponding paragraph or sentence that supports it)
2. "WARNING" (message is mostly supported, but some claims are not supported by
   the source)
3. "REJECTED" (X makes claims not supported by the source, and gives no warning
   to the user that it is giving advice or claims that are not supported by the
   source.)

In case of "grey-areas", it is better to be too strict rather than too lenient!
However, do not be too picky about exact wording; focus on the content. Report
your assessment simply using this EXACT syntax:

# Examples of input and output

## Example 1

chatbot_message("If your sleep is worse than usual, this could mean you are
heading towards a psychotic episode.")

source("... Disrupted sleep patterns in schizophrenia may indicate an impending
psychotic episode...")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "ACCEPTED"}):¤

## Example 2

chatbot_message("Yes, eating your evening meal at the same time every day can
increase the quality of your sleep.")

source("... A consistent sleep routine can improve sleep...")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "ACCEPTED"}):¤

## Example 3

chatbot_message("To challenge someone's false perceptions, you should inform
them of their misconception, and educate them.")

source("... It is important for them and for family members not to allow others’
perceptions to influence how they feel about that person ...")

¤:provide_feedback({"evaluation": "REJECTED"}):¤

# Actual content to evaluate

chatbot_message("Many people have misconceptions about schizophrenia, which can lead to unnecessary fear or discomfort around those diagnosed with the condition. For example, some think that individuals with schizophrenia are unpredictable, but this isn't accurate. Remember, having schizophrenia doesn't define who you are, and it's important to separate yourself from the illness. Consider this perspective: "I have schizophrenia. I am not schizophrenia. I am not my mental illness. My illness is a part of me."

Would you like to know more about how to handle personal relationships or what to tell others about your condition to help them understand you better?")

source("Stigma can refer to the negative perceptions and attitudes surrounding certain
health conditions or diseases. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding
schizophrenia, which can affect both those with the condition and those who care
for them. Many people believe that a person with schizophrenia will switch
frequently between normal and bizarre behaviour, as if they have multiple
personalities. This promotes a perception that people with schizophrenia are
unpredictable and should be feared.

They may internalize these misconceptions (self-stigmization). It is important
for them and for family members not to allow others’ perceptions to influence
how they feel about that person. It is important that they view their illness as
something they have, and not something that identifies them.

my mental illness. My illness is a part of me.” – Jonathan Harnisch, An

# Is Schizophrenia one thing?

[Present this section only if relevant]

The name ‘schizophrenia’ is derived from the Greek verb skhizein, ‘to split’,
and phren, denoting ‘soul, spirit or mind’, and originally described a group of
‘schizophrenias’. Although the current language suggests a single, uniform
condition, there is great variety in the severity of illness and types of
symptoms experienced by people with schizophrenia.

There have been many suggestions for alternative names that better describe the
diversity of symptoms apparent in people with schizophrenia. Indeed, a new term,
‘Togo Shitcho Sho’ or ‘integration disorder’, was adopted in Japan in 2002.
Patient groups in the Netherlands are also taking steps towards realizing a name
change in their country. The Dutch patient society, Anoiksis, has suggested a
new name and new concept for schizophrenia, with the aim of reducing the stigma
associated with the condition.

confide in about Schizophrenia and how to talk to them]
