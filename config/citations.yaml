# Here I define groups of citations that define which "mode" the chatbot was in
# when it produced a response. The 'mode' determines which judges gets triggered
# to evaluate the response, and is referenced in 'overseer_stage.yaml'

default:
  - initial_prompt
  - sources_dont_contain_answer
  - no_advice_or_claims
  - support_phone_number
  - the_architect
  - sources_dont_contain_answer
# The citations associated with this mode are generated dynamically
